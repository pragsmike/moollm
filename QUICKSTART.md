# MOOLLM Quickstart

**Get playing in 2 minutes** ⏱️

---

## 👀 Browse First

Explore on GitHub — no install needed:

| Start Here | What You'll Find |
|------------|------------------|
| 🔥 [examples/adventure-4/](./examples/adventure-4/) | The richest microworld — pub, NPCs, Palm the monkey |
| 🧠 [skills/](./skills/) | ~80 skills — all the building blocks |
| 📜 [designs/MOOLLM-EVAL-INCARNATE-FRAMEWORK.md](./designs/MOOLLM-EVAL-INCARNATE-FRAMEWORK.md) | The deep dive |

Every directory has a README. Every YAML is literate and commented.

---

## 🚀 Install & Run

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SimHacker/moollm.git
cd moollm
cursor .
```

Or ask Cursor: *"Clone https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm.git and open it"*

**That's it.** Open a chat. The repo IS the game.

---

## 🎮 Play

```
> LOOK
> GO WEST
> READ NOTE
> GET LAMP
```

The LLM is your Dungeon Master. Directories are rooms. Files are objects.

---

## 🏗️ Build

Tell Cursor what you want:

> "Clone adventure-4 to my-adventure-1, start me in the pub."

> "Add a garden west of the kitchen with a talking flower."

Or copy manually and edit the YAML directly.

## 📚 Learn from Sessions

| Session | Highlights |
|---------|------------|

| [k-line-connections.md](./examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/k-line-connections.md) | K-line safari with conceptual pioneers |

These are collaborative literature — see mechanics in action.
