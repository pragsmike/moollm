# MOOLLM Quickstart

**Get playing in 2 minutes** ⏱️

## 👀 Browse First (Zero Commitment)

Just explore the repo on GitHub — no install needed!

| Browse This | What You'll See |
|-------------|-----------------|
| [examples/adventure-2/](./examples/adventure-2/) | A played world — Captain Ashford's legendary run |
| [examples/adventure-3/](./examples/adventure-3/) | A fresh playable microworld — **clone this one!** |
| [skills/](./skills/) | All the building blocks — rooms, cards, adventures |
| [kernel/](./kernel/) | The operating system layer — constitution, protocols |
| [PROTOCOLS.yml](./PROTOCOLS.yml) | K-Lines — Wikipedia-style behavior triggers |
| [README.md](./README.md) | The full vision and lineage |

Every directory has a `README.md` that GitHub renders beautifully. Click around. Read the YAML files — they're literate, commented, designed to be understood. **This is markup and data as literature.**

## 🚀 Ready to Play? Get Started in Cursor

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SimHacker/moollm.git
cd moollm
cursor .
```

Or just open Cursor and ask:

> "Clone https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm.git and open it"

**That's it.** Open a chat. Start talking. The repo IS the game.

---

## 🎮 Three Ways to Play

### 1. Play an Adventure

Open [examples/adventure‑3/](./examples/adventure-3/) — it's ready to go!

```
> LOOK
> GET LAMP
> GO WEST
> READ LETTER
```

The LLM is your Dungeon Master. The filesystem is the world. Chat commands become actions. Files track state.

### 2. Read a Legendary Playthrough

Open [examples/adventure‑2/README.md](./examples/adventure-2/README.md) — the complete transcript of Captain Ashford's epic journey:
- Slew a grue with blue cheese
- Made 8 promises to Mother, kept them all
- Wrote a PhD-level postmodern deconstruction paper
- 100+ generated photos

See how an adventure unfolds. Learn the mechanics. Steal ideas.

### 3. Build Your Own World

Just tell Cursor:

> "Clone examples/adventure-3 to examples/my-run-1, then start it — I wake up and look around."

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r examples/adventure-3 examples/my-adventure
```

**What happens:** You'll see detailed results in chat (sometimes raw YAML), but Cursor also weaves your narrative into the adventure's `README.md` — complete with YAML Jazz commentary, links to artifacts, rooms, items, skill definitions, and image prompts.

**Fork & branch first:** Ask Cursor to fork the repo and create your own branch — now you have your own copy to experiment with freely.

**Add, commit, push:** When you save your work to GitHub, your adventure's README.md becomes a beautifully formatted web page! Hypertext links let you browse rooms, examine objects, and trace your journey. Your playthrough becomes a shareable, navigable story.

**Make PRs:** Developed a cool skill, mechanic, or adventure? Ask Cursor to make a pull request to share your improvements with the community!

**Don't know git?** Just ask Cursor! *"Fork this repo, create a branch called my-adventure, add my changes, commit, and push."* It handles everything — no shell commands to memorize. But watch what it does and learn! **This is constructionist education at its finest.** You're not just playing — you're learning git, YAML, file structures, and LLM patterns by doing.

You can create and edit the YAML directly in Cursor's text editor — or just tell Cursor what you want:

> "Add a garden room west of the kitchen with a mysterious talking flower."

The LLM creates the files, connects the exits, writes the descriptions. Looking at the files helps you understand how it works — but you don't *have* to touch them.

**K-Lines:** The [PROTOCOLS.yml](./PROTOCOLS.yml) file defines symbolic names — like Wikipedia's policy shortcuts (`WP:NPOV`, `WP:RS`) but for LLM behavior. These are Marvin Minsky's "K-Lines" from *Society of Mind*: names that activate conceptual clusters. Type `YAML-JAZZ` and the LLM interprets comments semantically. Type `SPEED-OF-LIGHT` and it simulates multiple agents in one call. Type `POSTEL` and it interprets your input charitably. UPPER-CASE-DASHED names, greppable cognitive triggers — name-activated behaviors.

## 📂 The Three Adventures

| Adventure | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| [adventure‑1/](./examples/adventure-1/) | **World Building** — Watch a world emerge from chat prompts. README documents creation. | ✅ Template |
| [adventure‑2/](./examples/adventure-2/) | **Legendary Playthrough** — Full transcript, playing and evolving a world, emergent mechanics, epic moments. | ✅ Completed |
| [adventure‑3/](./examples/adventure-3/) | **Fresh Start** — Rich advanced mechanics, crafting, npcs, clean slate, ready to play. Clone this one! | 🎮 **PLAY ME** |

**The Progression:**
- **adventure‑1** created the world (documented)
- **adventure‑2** played and extended it (transcript)
- **adventure‑3** reset with improvements (template)

**To preserve adventure‑3 as a template:**

Just tell Cursor:
> "Clone adventure-3 to adventure-4, rename my character to 'Captain Starlight', and start me in the kitchen making breakfast."

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r examples/adventure-3 examples/adventure-4
```

## 💡 What Makes This Different

| Black Box Agent | MOOLLM |
|-----------------|--------|
| "Trust me, I remember" | Read the YAML — see everything |
| Crashes on missing data | Self-heals, continues |
| Single user, single agent | Many agents talk in ONE LLM call |
| Hidden state | **Everything is files** |
| Text generator | **Coherence Engine** — referee, simulator, DM |

**Key insight:** Directories are rooms. Files are objects. The hierarchy IS the world.

---

## 🎯 Your First Session

1. **Open adventure‑3 in Cursor**
2. **Chat:** "I wake up. LOOK. GO WEST. READ NOTE."
3. **Compose your reply to Mother** — your promises become your goals, kickstarting world generation!
4. **Explore:** GO NORTH, LOOK, EXAMINE, TAKE things
5. **Write back to Mother** — your promises become your goals!

The LLM tracks state in the YAML files. Look at `player.yml` to see your inventory, gold, and location update.

## 🧠 Core Concepts (60 seconds)

| Concept | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| [**FILES-AS-STATE**](./PROTOCOLS.yml) | No hidden memory. Everything in files you can read. |
| [**YAML-JAZZ**](./skills/yaml-jazz/) | Comments carry meaning. `timeout: 30 # API flaky Mondays` |
| [**ROOMS**](./skills/room/) | Directories are places. Enter = navigate. Objects inside. |
| [**CARDS**](./skills/card/) | Characters/tools as templates. Play them in rooms. |
| [**SPEED-OF-LIGHT**](./skills/speed-of-light/) | Many agents simulate in ONE LLM call. No round trips. |
| [**POSTEL**](./skills/postel/) | Be liberal in input. Interpret charitably. Never crash. |
| [**PLAY-LEARN-LIFT**](./skills/play-learn-lift/) | Explore → find patterns → crystallize into skills. |

## 🔧 Extending Adventures

### Add a Room

```bash
mkdir examples/adventure-3/garden
```

Create `ROOM.yml`:
```yaml
room:
  name: The Hidden Garden
  description: |
    Overgrown with strange flowers that seem to whisper.
  exits:
    south:
      destination: ../kitchen/
      description: "Back to the kitchen"
  objects:
    - mysterious-flower.yml
```

### Add an Object

Create `mysterious-flower.yml`:
```yaml
object:
  name: Mysterious Flower
  portable: true
  description: |
    It pulses with an inner light. Smells like... memories?
  actions:
    SMELL:
      effect: "You remember something you forgot long ago..."
    PICK:
      effect: "It comes away easily. The garden sighs."
```

### Connect It

Edit `kitchen/ROOM.yml` to add an exit:
```yaml
exits:
  north:
    destination: ../garden/
    description: "A hidden door behind the fridge"
```

**Done.** The LLM will find it. The world grows.

## 🎪 The Bigger Picture

MOOLLM is **constructionist computing for LLMs**:

- **Papert & Kay** — Learning by building inspectable things
- **The Sims** — Objects advertise, agents select autonomously
- **HyperCard** — Non-programmers building interactive systems
- **MUD/LambdaMOO** — Rooms, objects, verbs, spatial programming
- **Zork/Adventure** — Text adventures as the original CLI

> *"If you can build it, you can understand it. If you can inspect it, you can trust it."*
