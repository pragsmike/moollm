  inputs:
    charter: "00-charter.yml"
    resolution: "03-resolution.yml"
    
  rubric:
    criteria:
      - alignment_with_goal: "Does it solve the stated problem?"
      - completeness: "Are all success criteria met?"
      - feasibility: "Is the implementation plan realistic?"
      - risk_mitigation: "Are potential downsides addressed?"
      
  scores:
    alignment_with_goal:
      score: 5/5
      rationale: |
        The "Federalist Directory Model" directly addresses the charter's goal of 
        separating "Core" (Kernel) from "User" (Worlds) content.
        
    completeness:
      score: 4/5
      rationale: |
        Success criteria met:
        - Boundary definition: CLEAR (kernel vs worlds).
        - Independence mechanism: CLEAR (Shadowing).
        - Dependency handling: PARTIAL. The resolution mentions "Locked List" for safety,
          but does not fully detail how migration of existing dependencies will happen.
          
    feasibility:
      score: 5/5
      rationale: |
        Renaming directories and adding a lookup path to the loader is a standard
        pattern with high likelihood of success.
        
    risk_mitigation:
      score: 4/5
      rationale: |
        The "Locked List" effectively mitigates the security risk of shadowing.
        Operational burden of "two places to look" (Samir's concern implied) is
        accepted as a tradeoff for isolation.
        
  decision:
    outcome: "RATIFIED"
    confidence: "High"
    
  critique:
    strengths:
      - "Elegant use of directory structure to enforce governance."
      - "Shadowing pattern allows maximum user freedom without breaking system invariants."
    weaknesses:
      - "The 'Locked List' needs a concrete specification in the Kernel before rollout."
      - "Migration of existing projects to 'worlds/' will require a script."
      
  recommendation: "Proceed to Implementation."
