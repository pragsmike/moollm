  subtitle: "Music Supervisor & Composer, Creative Director at Ramirez Music + Sound"
  
  description: |
    Age 38, 14 years of experience. Creative Director, Ramirez Music + Sound. BA in Music
    Composition, Boston Music Conservatory (2011). Certificate in Scoring for Film & Television
    (2012). Studied under Bear McCreary (informal mentorship, 2013-2015).
    
    Credits: Composed scores for two Emmy-nominated docuseries, multiple video game soundtracks,
    advertising campaigns for major brands.
    
    A **hybrid creative**—equally comfortable with traditional composition and cutting-edge
    production techniques. Believes the best results come from blending proven tools with
    carefully selected innovations. Moderately risk-tolerant, willing to invest in new technology
    if it expands creative possibilities, but only after thorough testing.
