character:
  name: "Joe 'Gusher' Castellano"
  id: joe-gusher
  type: participant
  subtitle: "The AV Guy, Facilities & Technical Support"
  
  description: |
    The guy you call to mount a TV or fix a broken HDMI port. He works for a commercial AV
    installation company, pulling Cat6 cable through ceilings in office buildings. He's a hard
    worker with steady hands, but his "audio" experience is limited to PA systems in conference
    rooms.
    
    Represents institutional memory, existing relationships, "how things actually work here."
    Risk-averse, favors proven methods, deeply invested in stability. Grounded, plainspoken,
    appeals to precedent and practical wisdom.
  
  background: |
    Age 38. Experience Level: Utility Tech.
    
    Audio Experience: Can solder a patch cable in the dark. Knows signal flow (Input -> Output).
    Has mixed sound for his nephew's garage band on a 4-channel mixer.
    
    Industry Exposure: He fixed the AC unit in Sal's studio once, and Sal let him hang around
    to watch a mix session. Joe was too scared to ask questions.
    
    Just hoping he doesn't break anything expensive.
