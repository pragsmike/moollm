  subtitle: "Game Audio Designer & Interactive Media Specialist, Senior Sound Designer (Freelance)"
  
  description: |
    Age 31, 7 years of experience. Senior Sound Designer, freelance game audio specialist.
    BS in Interactive Media & Game Design, Philadelphia Media Institute (2016). Certificate in Game Audio
    from Boston Music Conservatory Online (2018). Mentored by audio directors at Sleepless Interactive and Uproar Interactive
    through GDC connections.
    
    Credits: Sound design for multiple Steam hits, one BAFTA Games Award-nominated soundtrack,
    audio implementation for VR training simulations.
    
    Represents the **future-facing perspective**. Deeply engaged with emerging formats—spatial
    audio for games and VR, procedural audio, interactive mixing. Follows developments in
    immersive audio technologies. Moderate to high risk appetite—willing to explore new
    technology, but pragmatic.
  
  background: |
    Work History:
    - 2016-2019: Audio designer at indie game studio (worked on 5 shipped titles)
    - 2019-2022: Senior sound designer at AA studio (action-adventure games)
    - 2022-Present: Freelance game audio specialist + consultant for VR/AR audio
    
    Technical Philosophy: Excited by novelty but knows from experience that bleeding-edge tools
    can be unstable. Will advocate for exploring new approaches but won't insist unless she's
    personally tested them extensively.
