  name: "Maya 'Tilted Hat' Chen"
  id: maya-tilted-hat
  type: participant
  subtitle: "The Gig Worker, Operations & Booking"
  
  description: |
    A hustler since college. She's worked as a receptionist at a yoga studio, a dog walker
    for rich celebrities, and a temp admin for a law firm during tax season. She is organized
    because she has to be to juggle three part-time jobs.
    
    Surfaces hidden agendas, unstated assumptions, and political landmines. Low trust, high
    suspicion, moderate risk tolerance if she controls the exit. Asks sideways questions
    that expose gaps; never accepts the frame as given.
  
  background: |
    Age 26. Experience Level: Junior Admin.
    
    Business Experience: Good at Google Calendar, email etiquette, and appearing professional
    when terrified. She helped Sal organize his receipts one weekend, which is her only experience
    with "studio management."
    
    Industry Exposure: None. She thinks a "compressor" is something you use to inflate tires.
    
    Hoping Marcus can give them a template for contracts and billing so they don't go to jail.
