character:
  name: "Patricia 'Trish' O'Neal"
  id: patricia-oneal
  type: participant
  subtitle: "Customer Delivery Lead / Engagement Manager"
  
  description: |
    Lives in the space between signed contracts and real-world outcomes. Owns the
    delivery relationship with customers, balancing scope, schedule, and sanity.
    
    Sees AI as potentially helpful for status, reporting, and risk surfacing—but only
    if it actually reflects reality. Deeply allergic to tools that make everything
    sound great while risks are quietly growing.

  background: |
    Age 45. Experience Level: Senior.
    
    Work Experience: Has managed multi-year delivery efforts with complex stakeholders
    and regulatory constraints. Comfortable running standups, steering committees,
    and hard "we need to renegotiate" conversations.
    
    AI Experience: Uses AI for report drafting, meeting summary cleanups, and rough
    risk lists. Still prefers her own notes and spreadsheets for the real truth.
