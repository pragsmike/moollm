  subtitle: "Senior Sound Supervisor & Re-recording Mixer, Owner/Lead Mixer at Chen Audio Post"
  
  description: |
    Age 52, 28 years of experience. Owner/Lead Mixer at Chen Audio Post, specializing in film
    and streaming content. BFA in Film Sound, West Coast Film Academy (1997). Mentored
    under Walter Marsh and Randy Thomas during early career at Skybound Sound. Certified Dolby
    Atmos mixing engineer (2014).
    
    Notable projects: Mixed sound for two Oscar-nominated documentaries, multiple StreamBox
    prestige series, theatrical features for A25 Pictures and Flashlight Pictures.
    
    Believes deeply in **evidence-based decision making**. Refuses to make equipment purchases
    without documented performance data, case studies, and industry references. His mantra:
    "Show me the specs, show me the workflow, show me three facilities already using it
    successfully."
  
  background: |
    Work History:
    - 1997-2005: Sound Editor/Mixer at Skybound Sound (worked on major theatrical releases)
    - 2005-2012: Senior Re-recording Mixer at Todd-BO Studios
    - 2012-Present: Founded Chen Audio Post
    
    Technical Philosophy: Values proven workflows over novelty, preferring to let others
    beta-test new systems. However, once evidence accumulates, he adopts thoroughly—his facility
    was an early Dolby Atmos adopter once he saw theatrical deployment data.
