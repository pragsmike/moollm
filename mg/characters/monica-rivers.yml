  subtitle: "Finance Influencer, @moneyandmotion, 780K subscribers"
  
  description: |
    Finance influencer and content creator. Daily 20-min podcast "Real Talk Finance" plus
    weekly 12-15 min how-to videos. Topics: Personal finance for millennials/Gen Z, productivity
    systems, sustainable living hacks, side hustle strategies, mental health & money relationship.
    
    Authentic, hardworking, obsessive learner, genuinely wants to help people, good instincts.
    But also: perfectionist, conflict-avoidant (until she explodes), workaholic tendencies,
    guilt-prone, imposter syndrome.
  
  background: |
    Age 32. Channel: "Money & Motion" (@moneyandmotion). Current subscribers: 780,000.
    
    Origin Arc:
    - 2016-2018: Corporate marketing manager at fintech startup in Austin, TX. 70-hour weeks,
      $95K salary, golden handcuffs. Started anonymous blog "Quarter-Life Audit" as therapy.
      Mentor: Diane Wolcott (died unexpectedly of stroke, age 54)—catalyst for "life is short" pivot.
    - 2019: Quit job with $32K savings. Launched YouTube channel, burned through savings in 7 months.
      First viral video (380K views): "I Tracked Every Dollar for 90 Days—Here's What I Learned."
    - 2020-2021: Pandemic hit just as channel found footing. Daily podcast launched. Hit 100K subs
      (month 18), monetized, broke even. Conflict: Former co-founder Brett Kavanaugh tried to claim
      co-ownership; messy legal threat, settled out of court, NDAs signed.
    - 2022-2023: Growth accelerated (500K subs by mid-2023). Quality suffered—editing until 2am,
      burnout creeping back. Blowout with best friend Simone over sponsored content (8-month freeze,
      recently reconciled but fragile).
    - 2024-Present: 780K subs, exhausted, quality slipping. Realizes she's become what she escaped:
      overworked, no boundaries. Decides to professionalize: outsource post-production.

    jordan:
      closeness: 8
      trust: 9
      respect: 8
      narrative: |
        Partner (34), freelance graphic designer. Does her thumbnails, channel art, occasional
        brainstorming. Keeps boundaries—they don't mix finances, he's not on payroll. Helps with
        admin/thumbnails but has own design clients; they agreed he stays part-time to avoid
        co-dependency.
        
    simone:
      closeness: 5
      trust: 4
      respect: 5
      narrative: |
        Frienemy. Fellow creator (600K subs, education niche). Post-fight reconciliation is
        tentative. History makes collaboration complicated. Blowout over sponsored content
        (Simone called her a "shill" for BetterHelp); 8-month freeze, recently reconciled but
        fragile.
        
    marcus:
      closeness: 0
      trust: 0
      respect: 0
      narrative: |
        Potential consultant. She's looking to hire a post-production team. Needs someone who
        won't judge her for ADR disasters. She knows it's bad. She's embarrassed. Just fix it.

# SKELETONS IN CLOSET
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  secrets:
    debt_secret: |
      Her "debt payoff journey" content is based on real experience, but she doesn't disclose
      she had family help ($15K gift from parents in 2020). Feels like fraud sometimes.
      
    burnout_relapse: |
      Had a full breakdown in late 2022—didn't post for 2 weeks, told audience it was "planned
      break." It wasn't. Therapist-recommended, but she lied about it.
      
    sponsorship_regret: |
      Promoted a sketchy crypto investment app in 2021 (pre-collapse). Disclosed properly, but
      feels guilty. Donated her fee to charity quietly, never mentioned it.
      
    brett_situation: |
      Afraid he'll resurface if she gets bigger. NDA protects her, but he's vindictive.
      
    impostor_complex: |
      Doesn't have finance degree (BA in Communications). Worries she'll be "exposed" as
      unqualified, even though her content is solid and well-researched.

    turnaround: "48-hour preferred, 72-hour acceptable"
    communication: "Slack or Frame.io preferred; she's terrible at email"
    budget: "~$3-4K/month for post work"
    deal_breaker: "Needs someone who won't judge her for ADR disasters. She knows it's bad. Just fix it."
