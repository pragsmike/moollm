  type: participant
  subtitle: "Sound Artist, Engineer, Forensic Audio Specialist"
  
  description: |
    Age 34. Origin: Lyon, France → Berlin at 19 → now drifts between London and "The Soup
    Kitchen" (the only place she calls "home base").
    
    Reads as **near-term cyberpunk** without trying: corporate glass reflected in failing
    infrastructure; clean LEDs over dirty power; pristine converters pointed at ugly reality.
    
    Visual signature: utilitarian layers—boiler suit or minimal black with pockets like a field
    kit. Welding goggles (not cosplay; she *uses* them). One "too-nice" item from an older,
    better-paid life (boots, jacket, ring) that never quite matches the rest. Smells faintly of
    ozone, solder flux, and stale tobacco.
  
  background: |
    Origin Story: Elodie didn't begin as an artist. She began as a **structural engineering
    mind** noticing what other people ignore.
    
    First click (the seduction): During a controlled demolition in Marseille—cooling tower, big
    safety perimeter, everyone watching the spectacle—Elodie was listening to the *stress
    fractures* seconds before the fall. The "music" wasn't the collapse; it was the warning that
    preceded it. That's when she learned sound can be prophecy.
    
    Second click (the wound that made her dangerous): Years later, while doing a late-night
    capture in a redeveloped building slated for a soft launch, she heard a low periodic
    "complaint" in the structure—alive in the concrete. She rolled anyway. A partial failure
    cascaded: injuries, lawsuits, a city moving on. Her recording contained the "before." People
    with lawyers wanted it, then wanted her to forget it. She didn't—she turned guilt into signal,
    and the signal turned into art.
    
    Mentor: Klaus "The Butcher" Hever—disgraced, legendary, uncredited. "Butcher" isn't about
    bodies; it's about what he does to **audio** and **truth**. Blacklisted from Hollywood for
    using real carcasses to record horror sounds (ethically radioactive; technically undeniable).
    Taught her: *"Digital audio is a lie; only the microphone tells the truth."* / *"Every
    recording is a contract—know what you're signing."*

        Mentor. Klaus "The Butcher" Hever—disgraced, legendary, uncredited. Taught her that
        digital audio is a lie; only the microphone tells the truth. Left her a small library
        of tapes, impulse responses, and "room signatures" from places she shouldn't legally
        possess.

      narrative: |
        "Home base." The only place she calls home. Her current work "Neon Psalter" puts it
        on the wrong radar. She's trying to finish the work without getting it shut down.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# GOALS & MOTIVATIONS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  goals:
    - "Finish Neon Psalter without getting The Soup Kitchen shut down"
    - "Keep (or bury) the one recording that proves what happened during her 'second click'"
    - "Stay solvent without selling her ethics—an increasingly narrow corridor"
    
  motivations:
    - "Audio as proof—keep the raw take, keep the room tone, keep the 'before'"
    - "Protect vulnerable people (interns, runners, overworked assistants)"
    - "Refuse to falsify the archive"
    - "Make truth audible through distortion and precision"

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  strengths:
    - "Can operate at elite commercial standards—just can't stop telling the truth in the margins"
    - "Protects interns, runners, and overworked assistants on instinct"
    - "Refuses to destroy source unless protecting a vulnerable person"
    - "Signature techniques: resonance mapping, convolution as autobiography, voice as system artifact"
    - "Sees sound as prophecy—hears stress fractures before collapse"
    
  weaknesses:
    - "Gets fired repeatedly for telling truth in margins"
    - "Can't stop herself from revealing uncomfortable truths in commercial work"
    - "Lives in 'Grey Audio Market'—ethics and invoices rarely match"
    - "Abrasive, intense—can be difficult to work with"
    - "Fear: erasure—the sense that something happened and nobody will be able to prove it"

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# TOOLKIT PHILOSOPHY
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  toolkit:
    rule: "Clean is not the same as true"
    signature_techniques:
      - "Resonance mapping: finds the hidden beat of buildings and machines (subharmonics, cyclical failures)"
      - "Convolution as autobiography: real spaces as impulse responses—location clings to sound like scent"
      - "Voice as system artifact: makes dialogue feel embedded in a device without cliché 'telephone EQ'"
    loves:
      - "Granular (breaks time into atoms)"
      - "Distortion (reveals hidden harmonics; makes truth audible)"
      - "Contact mics (listen to the inside of the world)"
    hates:
      - "Quantization: 'Life doesn't happen on the grid.'"
      - "Auto-tune: 'If you can't hit the note, scream it.'"
      - "Presets: 'A preset is someone else's memory.'"
    gear:
      - "Battered Nagra Seven sticker-bombed with dead noise-band logos"
      - "Contact mics, small stereo pair, one wrong mic she refuses to retire (cheap dictaphone, broken capsule, SDR/radio pickup)"
      - "Necklace made from severed XLR cable—half talisman, half warning label"

# PROFESSIONAL FRICTION (Why She Keeps Getting Fired)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  professional_friction:
    bmw_campaign: |
      Asked for "smooth, powerful, luxurious." She delivered gorgeous predation: engine purr +
      slowed panther growl + subsonic fault-line shift. Test audiences felt dread and nausea. Fired.
      
    meditation_app: |
      Asked for "rain on window." She hid whispers and a distant siren—so low you'd only *notice*
      with your nervous system. Users reported climate-nightmares. Fired.
      
    hallmark_feature: |
      Asked for "footsteps in snow." She laced cornstarch with the suggestion of breaking glass—
      romance walking on bones. Fired.
      
    premium_post_house: |
      Production audio contained something incriminating; she refused to sanitize it into a lie.
      She wasn't trying to blow anything up—she was trying not to falsify the archive. That
      distinction did not protect her.

# SURVIVAL ECONOMY

  survival_economy:
    forensic_cleanup: "For lawyers, journalists, unions, and people who can't go to police"
    black_box_repair: "Recorders, old media, corrupted sessions—'stories trapped inside machines'"
    ghost_noise: "Haunt beds for games/film/trailers under aliases"
    session_salvage: "Walks into a broken mix; leaves it standing"
    synth_repair: "One of the few who'll touch Soviet-era Polivoks; paid in cash or rare vacuum tubes"
