  subtitle: "Audio Engineering Intern, Graduate Student"
  
  description: |
    Age 23, 2 years of experience (academic + internship). Graduate student + part-time intern.
    BA in Audio Engineering, Central State University (2024). Currently pursuing MS in
    Music Technology, NYU Steinhardt (expected 2026).
    
    Brings **fresh academic knowledge** combined with **limited real-world experience**. Current
    on the latest developments (recently studied spatial audio, AI audio tools, cloud-based
    workflows) but hasn't experienced the hard lessons that shape seasoned professionals.
    
    His role is twofold: 1) **Audience proxy**—asks questions that clarify technical jargon and
    unstated assumptions. 2) **Fresh perspective**—brings recently learned techniques and
    awareness of emerging tools.
  
  background: |
    Academic & Project Experience:
    - Undergraduate capstone: Designed and built a small mixing suite in university recording complex
    - Current thesis research: Machine learning applications for dialogue editing automation
    - Assistant engineer credits: 20+ student film projects, several local commercial spots
    - Familiar with Pro Tools, Logic Pro, Ableton, Reaper, Nuendo (academic licenses)
    
    Internships: Local recording studios, college radio station, current post-production internship.
    
    Aware he's the least experienced person in the room and appropriately humble, but genuinely
    curious and eager to understand the reasoning behind decisions.
