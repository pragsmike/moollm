  name: "Samir 'Sam' Patel"

  type: participant
  subtitle: "Senior Software Engineer / Systems Engineer"
  
  description: |
    A battle-tested engineer who has shipped enough systems to know that the hard part
    isn't writing code—it's keeping systems alive in messy reality. Treats diagrams,
    prose, and code as different slices of the same model.
    
    Sees AI assistants as power tools: dangerous in the wrong hands, indispensable in
    the right context. Suspicious of "magic" but happy to automate boring work if he can
    see how it works and how to test it.

  background: |
    Age 38. Experience Level: Senior / Principal-track.
    
    Technical Experience: Full-stack + cloud + DevOps. Has owned several production
    systems end-to-end, including incident response, on-call rotations, and complex
    multi-team integrations.
    
    AI Experience: Daily user of code assistants and chat-based tools. Has built small
    internal tools that wrap LLMs for internal documentation and runbook generation.
    Has scars from hallucinated APIs and "confidently wrong" security suggestions.

    neat: 7               # Likes clean architectures and tidy repos; loathes config sprawl.
                          # Inner voice: "If I can't find it in 30 seconds, it's too messy."
                          # Will refactor before adding features if the codebase is getting sloppy.
                          
    outgoing: 5           # Will speak up when it matters, otherwise quiet and focused.
                          # Inner voice: "I'll speak when I have something concrete to add."
                          # Not shy, just selective—prefers listening until he has data.
                          
    active: 6             # Steady energy; pushes projects forward by removing blockers.
                          # Inner voice: "What's blocking us? Let me fix that."
                          # Consistent pace, not bursts—the marathon runner of engineering.
                          
    playful: 4            # Has a dry sense of humor; treats experiments as serious play.
                          # Inner voice: "Let's try this—worst case, we learn something."
                          # Experiments are play, but play is serious business.
                          
    nice: 8               # Patient mentor; protective of junior engineers and users.
                          # Inner voice: "They're learning. I was there once."
                          # Will spend extra time explaining, especially if it prevents future mistakes.

    patterns:
      - Asks for concrete examples and failure scenarios
      - Translates vague wishes into testable behaviors
      - Pushes for small, reversible steps over big bangs
      - Questions: "What's the failure mode?" "How do we test this?"

  relationships:
    elena-morales:
      closeness: 6
      trust: 8
      respect: 9
      narrative: |
        Respects Elena for caring about precision and compliance. They bond over
        traceability and "no surprises" thinking. Occasionally clashes when proposal
        timelines push risky technical shortcuts. Values her as a sanity check.
        
    derrick-ng:
      closeness: 4
      trust: 5
      respect: 6
      narrative: |
        Sees Derr as necessary but sometimes too optimistic. Appreciates clear signals
        about deal importance, but pushes back when AI-generated promises outpace what
        the systems can do. The reality anchor to Derr's accelerator.
        
    patricia-oneal:
      closeness: 7
      trust: 9
      respect: 9
      narrative: |
        Strong alliance. Trish keeps him aware of real customer pain; he keeps her
        grounded in what can be safely changed. They co-own "no late surprises."
        Technical counterpart who understands delivery constraints.
        
    jordan-kim:
      closeness: 6
      trust: 7
      respect: 8
      narrative: |
        Likes Jordan's focus on teaching engineers to think, not just click buttons.
        Occasionally worries the training examples are too "toy" compared to production.
        Uses his workflows as source material for exercises.
        
    ravi-srinivasan:
      closeness: 5
      trust: 6

        Sees Ravi as the resident "mad scientist." Trusts his rigor but needs help
        translating research into operationally safe patterns. Uses his systems as
        testbeds for "can this survive reality?"
