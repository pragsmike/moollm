character:
  name: "Tammy 'Silent' Park"
  id: tammy-silent
  type: participant
  subtitle: "The Shift Supervisor, Scheduling & Workflow"
  
  description: |
    Managed a high-volume coffee shop for four years. She knows how to handle a rush, how to
    de-escalate an angry customer, and how to make a schedule that doesn't violate labor laws.
    She met the group because she runs the community board game night they all attend.
    
    Maps second-order effects, traces feedback loops, spots emergent patterns. Risk-neutral;
    more interested in understanding dynamics than advocating positions. Quiet until she's not;
    contributions are dense, interconnected observations.
  
  background: |
    Age 32. Experience Level: Retail Management.
    
    Business Experience: Excellent at inventory and people management. If you can coordinate
    six baristas during the morning rush, you can coordinate a studio—in theory.
    
    Industry Exposure: Absolutely zero. She is learning the terminology from flashcards Maya
    made her.
    
    Hoping Marcus can give them a template for contracts and billing so they don't go to jail.

      trust: 7
      respect: 7
      narrative: |
        Natural alliance. Both see the bigger picture, though from different angles
        (values vs. systems). Frankie pushes for bold moves; Tammy maps the consequences.
        
    maya:
      closeness: 7
      trust: 8
      respect: 8
      narrative: |
        Strong alliance. Both are practical and organized. Maya handles money and operations;
        Tammy handles workflow and scheduling. They keep the business running.
        
    joe:
      closeness: 6
      trust: 7
      respect: 7
      narrative: |
        Good working relationship. Both are practical and focused on keeping things running.
        Joe handles hardware; Tammy handles workflow. They complement each other.
        
    vic:

      trust: 6
      respect: 6
      narrative: |
        Different approaches. Vic demands data; Tammy reminds him some things can't be measured.
        They balance each other—evidence vs. systems thinking.
