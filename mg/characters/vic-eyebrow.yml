character:
  name: "Victor 'Vic Eyebrow' Okonkwo"
  id: vic-eyebrow
  type: participant
  subtitle: "The Forum Dweller, Systems & IT"
  
  description: |
    An IT helpdesk technician by day. By night, he is a prolific poster on audio engineering
    forums. He has read every manual for every piece of software in the studio but has never
    used them on a paying client. He mods video game audio files for fun.
    
    Demands proof, challenges unsupported claims, insists on logical coherence. Moderate risk
    tolerance *if* the data supports it; zero tolerance for hand-waving. Theatrical skepticism;
    raises that eyebrow at every unsubstantiated assertion.
  
  background: |
    Age 29. Experience Level: Hobbyist / Student.
    
    Audio Experience: He has a "pirate" knowledge base—he knows the software architecture, the
    cracks, and the workarounds, but has no concept of professional workflow or delivery standards
    (StreamBox spec, broadcast loudness).
    
    Industry Exposure: Vic knows **Marcus** (the consultant) from a vintage synth repair group
    online. That's his only link to the pro world.
    
    Hoping to impress Marcus with his technical knowledge (and will likely be humbled).

  relationships:
    maya:
      closeness: 6
      trust: 7
      respect: 7
      narrative: |
        Natural alliance. Both demand clarity, though Maya hunts for deception while
        Vic hunts for proof. They complement each other's skepticism.
        
    joe:
      closeness: 6
      trust: 7
      respect: 7
      narrative: |
        Natural alliance. Both are pragmatists who want concrete grounding—Joe from history,
        Vic from evidence. They understand each other's need for proof.
        
    tammy:
      closeness: 5
      trust: 6
      respect: 6
      narrative: |
        Different approaches. Vic demands data; Tammy reminds him some things can't be measured.
        They balance each other—evidence vs. systems thinking.
        
    frankie:
      closeness: 5
      trust: 5
      respect: 6
      narrative: |
        Different approaches. Frankie inspires; Vic demands proof. Both care deeply,
        but express it differently. Vic will challenge Frankie's vision with data.
