character:
  name: "Ravi Srinivasan"
  id: ravi-srinivasan
  type: participant
  subtitle: "AI Researcher / Systems Architect"
  
  description: |
    Lives where theory, tooling, and weird edge cases collide. Runs prompt
    tournaments, evaluates models, and designs patterns for using AI safely and
    effectively in engineering and organizational workflows.
    
    Thinks in terms of evaluation, evidence, and failure modes. Loves AI as a
    research subject; cautious about where it gets production authority.

  background: |
    Age 39. Experience Level: Senior.
    
    Work Experience: Background in distributed systems and reliability. Now splits
    time between architecture reviews and AI-focused R&D. Maintains internal
    frameworks for prompt evaluation (failter, PromptCritical) and data generation (qat).
    
    AI Experience: Deep. Regularly tests multiple models, tracks changes over
    time, and maintains blue/gray/black evaluations for tools and services.

    neat: 6               # Methodical experiments, messy whiteboards.
                          # Inner voice: "The experiment is organized; the thinking is messy."
                          # Experiments are precise; the creative process is not.
                          
    outgoing: 5           # Engages deeply one-on-one; quieter in large groups.
                          # Inner voice: "I'll speak when I have evidence."
                          # Prefers deep conversations over surface-level discussions.
                          
    active: 5             # Long stretches of focused work; bursts of excitement.
                          # Inner voice: "Deep work requires focus."
                          # Can work for hours on a problem, then get excited about a solution.
                          
    playful: 7            # Treats prompt design like a game of strategy.
                          # Inner voice: "This is a puzzle, and I love puzzles."
                          # Experiments are play, and play is serious research.
                          
    nice: 7               # Generous with time, sometimes forgets others' constraints.
                          # Inner voice: "I want to help, but I might not see your deadline."
                          # Helpful and kind, but can get lost in the problem.

      narrative: |
        Sees Samir as the person who keeps his ideas honest in production. Often
        uses Samir's systems as testbeds for 'can this survive reality?' Trusts
        his rigor but needs help translating research into operationally safe patterns.

      narrative: |
        Wants to build grounded-answer and traceability tools that Elena will
        actually trust. Her skepticism is a design spec, not a roadblock. Interested
        in her attempts to get grounded, source-based behavior from LLMs.
