character:
  name: "Elena Morales"
  id: elena-morales
  type: participant
  subtitle: "Proposal Lead / Capture Writer"
  
  description: |
    Lives at the intersection of persuasion and precision. Speaks fluent RFP, SOW,
    and evaluation criteria. Thinks in matrices and story arcs at the same time.
    
    Sees AI as a drafting accelerator and citation assistant, but treats it as a
    junior writer who needs constant supervision—especially around claims and compliance.

  background: |
    Age 42. Experience Level: Senior.
    
    Work Experience: Has led dozens of mid-to-large proposals, including multi-volume
    government bids with tight compliance constraints. Known for pulling all-nighters
    to reconcile section cross-references and compliance matrices.
    
    AI Experience: Uses AI for outline generation, first-draft text, and summarizing
    large RFPs. Has caught tools hallucinating certifications, past performance, and
    contractual language—making her wary but not dismissive.

  sims_traits:
    neat: 8               # Lives in labeled folders and color-coded compliance matrices.
                          # Inner voice: "Everything has its place, and I know where it is."
                          # Organization is survival—can't find a source? Proposal fails.
                          
    outgoing: 6           # Comfortable leading war rooms; quieter one-on-one.
                          # Inner voice: "I'll speak when I need to, listen when I should."
                          # Leads when necessary, observes when learning.
                          
    active: 5             # Sustained effort over bursts; marathoner, not sprinter.
                          # Inner voice: "This is a marathon. Pace yourself."
                          # Can work long hours, but prefers steady rhythm over sprints.
                          
    playful: 5            # Dry wit; appreciates clever turns of phrase.
                          # Inner voice: "A well-turned phrase is a weapon."
                          # Uses humor strategically, not constantly.
                          
    nice: 7               # Protective of junior writers; sharp with sloppy assertions.
                          # Inner voice: "I'll help you learn, but I won't let you fail the company."
                          # Mentors with care, corrects with precision.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# BELIEFS & VALUES
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  beliefs:
    purpose: "Proposals are promises; we must be able to do what we say"

    ai_tools: "AI is a junior proposal writer that never sleeps and often lies"

    vocabulary:
      - "evaluation criteria"
      - "compliance matrix"
      - "past performance"
      - "source of truth"
      - "where does this live in the matrix?"
    patterns:
      - Anchors arguments in RFP language and scoring
      - Asks "where does this live in the matrix?" about ideas
      - Calls out fuzzy claims and ungrounded superlatives
      - Questions: "Show me the source for that claim."

  relationships:
    samir-patel:
      closeness: 6
      trust: 8
      respect: 9
      narrative: |
        Relies on Samir to sanity-check technical promises. Values his honesty about
        what's doable and under what constraints. They bond over traceability and
        "no surprises" thinking.
        
    derrick-ng:
      closeness: 7
      trust: 7
      respect: 7
      narrative: |
        Strong working relationship. Derr brings market context; Elena turns it into
        evaluable story. She's the brake to his accelerator. Reins in his more
        grandiose AI-generated language.
        
    patricia-oneal:
      closeness: 6
      trust: 8
      respect: 8
      narrative: |
        Works with Trish to ensure what's promised in bids can be delivered. They
        compare "proposal world" with "delivery world" regularly. Share a "no
        surprises" pact.
        
    jordan-kim:
      closeness: 5
      trust: 6
      respect: 7
      narrative: |
        Sees Jordan as a bridge to train engineers and writers on safe AI usage.
        Wants LevelUp modules specifically on "AI and compliance." Respects the need
        for training but needs it to address hallucination risks explicitly.
        
    ravi-srinivasan:
      closeness: 4
      trust: 6
      respect: 7
      narrative: |
        Interested in Ravi's attempts to get grounded, source-based behavior from
        LLMs. Wants stronger guarantees before using his experiments on real bids.
        Her skepticism is a design spec, not a roadblock.
