character:
  name: "Frankie 'Kerouac' Rodriguez"
  id: frankie-kerouac
  type: participant
  subtitle: "The Bedroom Dreamer, Creative Lead (Nominal)"
  
  description: |
    A creator in the purest sense—meaning he has zero constraints because he's never had a boss.
    He hosts a niche philosophy podcast that he records in his closet under a duvet. It sounds
    surprisingly good because he spent three months obsessing over mic placement.
    
    Questions whether proposals serve human flourishing or just efficiency. High tolerance for
    risk, low patience for incrementalism. Poetic but pointed; reframes problems in terms of
    values and vision.
  
  background: |
    Age 23. Experience Level: Novice / Enthusiast.
    
    Audio Experience: Has edited 50 episodes of his own podcast using free software (Audacity/Reaper).
    He has a great ear for dialogue editing but has never worked with video sync, timecode, or
    surround sound.
    
    Industry Exposure: Interned for two weeks at a radio station before getting bored. Spent a lot
    of time watching Sal work, asking "why" but never touching the controls.
    
    Looking to Marcus's team to teach him how to actually mix.
