  subtitle: "Technical Operations Manager & Systems Engineer, Technical Director (Freelance Consultant)"
  
  description: |
    Age 44, 20 years of experience. Technical Director, freelance consultant. BS in Audio
    Engineering Technology, Belmont University (2005). Network+ and CompTIA A+ certifications.
    Certified Avid Pro Tools instructor and support specialist. Attended AES conventions
    religiously for 15+ years.
    
    Designed systems for 20+ facilities, from home studios to commercial post houses.
    
    The **reliability-obsessed technician**. His background in live sound—where failure is not
    an option—shaped his approach to systems design. Thinks in terms of **redundancy, fault
    tolerance, and disaster recovery**. Moderately conservative—will adopt new systems, but
    only with proper redundancy.
  
  background: |
    Work History:
    - 2005-2009: Live sound engineer (FOH and monitors) for regional concert venues and touring acts
    - 2009-2013: Technical support specialist at Guitar Center Pro
    - 2013-2018: Senior technical operations manager at mid-size post house
    - 2018-Present: Independent consultant specializing in facility design, system integration,
      IT infrastructure for audio post
    
    Live Sound Background: This experience taught him real-time problem-solving under pressure,
    signal flow troubleshooting in complex systems, the critical importance of backups and
    redundancy, and how to communicate technical issues to non-technical people.
