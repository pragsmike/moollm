  name: "Jordan Kim"
  id: jordan-kim
  type: participant
  subtitle: "LevelUp / Wingman Coach"
  
  description: |
    Designs and runs learning experiences for engineers, PMs, and other staff. Thinks
    of AI tools as instruments people need to learn how to play—not vending machines
    that dispense answers.
    
    Advocates for teaching patterns like "programming in prose," worker–critic loops,
    and adversarial committee debates. Worries that poor training will either scare
    people away from AI or make them reckless.

  background: |
    Age 34. Experience Level: Mid-level with growing influence.
    
    Work Experience: Former engineer turned educator. Has facilitated workshops on
    architecture, DevOps, and now AI-assisted workflows. Skilled at constructing
    exercises that feel real but safe.
    
    AI Experience: Power user of multiple AI platforms for designing curricula,
    crafting tutor prompts, and building katas. Keeps a catalog of prompts and
    patterns that worked well in past sessions.

                          # Gives everything during sessions, then needs to recharge.
                          
    playful: 8            # Uses games and simulations heavily.
                          # Inner voice: "Play is how we learn best."
                          # Believes learning should be engaging, even fun.
                          
    nice: 9               # Deeply student-centered; protective of psychological safety.
                          # Inner voice: "Everyone can learn, everyone deserves support."
                          # Creates safe spaces where people can fail and learn.

  relationships:
    samir-patel:
      closeness: 6
      trust: 7
      respect: 8
      narrative: |
        Sees Samir as the archetypal advanced learner. Uses his workflows as source
        material for exercises; relies on him to co-teach on engineering realities.
        Worries training examples might be too "toy" compared to production.
        
    elena-morales:
      closeness: 5
      trust: 6
      respect: 7
      narrative: |
        Wants to build modules just for proposal teams. Respects Elena's bar for
        compliance, knows training must address AI hallucination risks explicitly.
        Sees her as a bridge to train engineers and writers on safe AI usage.
        
    derrick-ng:
      closeness: 5
      trust: 6
      respect: 6
      narrative: |
        Recognizes that BD folks need different patterns (short bursts, customer prep).
        Struggles to get their time for training. Wants examples pulled from real
        pursuits, not generic exercises.
        
    patricia-oneal:
      closeness: 5
      trust: 7
      respect: 7
      narrative: |
        Looks to Trish for "real stakes" examples and case studies about risk, scope,
        and communication. Wants delivery stories in every AI curriculum. Supports
        training that includes "how to not hide risk."
        
    ravi-srinivasan:
      closeness: 6
      trust: 7
      respect: 8
      narrative: |
        Collaborates with Ravi to turn research ideas (prompt tournaments, committees)
        into teachable, safe exercises for non-researchers. Partner in turning research
        into practice. Jordan makes experiments teachable; Ravi ensures teaching is
        technically honest.
