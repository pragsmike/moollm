  subtitle: "Business Development & Capture Manager"
  
  description: |
    Lives in the future pipeline. Constantly juggling opportunities, partners, and
    positioning. Sees AI as a way to move faster—on research, messaging, and
    stakeholder prep—without adding more slides to his life.
    
    Believes good BD is about telling a true story that customers can see themselves in.
    Worried that AI might make it too easy to overpromise or sound generic if not used carefully.

  background: |
    Age 36. Experience Level: Mid-to-senior.
    
    Work Experience: Has led captures from early market sensing through to final
    orals. Comfortable translating technical capability into value props and win themes.
    
    AI Experience: Heavy user of AI for market scans, competitor research, and first
    drafts of emails, one-pagers, and pitch decks. Recently burned by an AI-generated
    slide that cited a non-existent "industry ranking."
