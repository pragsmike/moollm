committee:
  name: "Strategy Review"
  purpose: "Review strategic decisions with diverse perspectives"
  status: convened
  protocol: roberts-rules
  
  session:
    topic: "How should we organize the source code to allow people to keep their worlds, adventures, etc. separate from the core skills and whatnot?"
    convened_at: "2024-12-19"
    transcript_file: "mg/COMMITTEE-SESSION.md"
  
  selection_strategy: balanced
  selection_rationale: |
    Selected using balanced strategy for deeper exploration:
    - Core 5-member pattern (paranoid_realism, idealism, continuity_guardian, 
      evidence_prosecutor, systems_thinking) ensures maximum diversity
    - Added operational_realism for operational depth and reality checking
    - All 6 members have unique propensity types, epistemologies, and debate roles
    - Balanced risk tolerance: 1 low, 1 high, 4 medium/varies
    - Ensures comprehensive exploration while maintaining consensus capability

# Committee Composition
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

composition_notes: |
  This balanced committee provides:
  
  TENSION:
  - Maya (paranoid, low risk) vs. Frankie (idealist, high risk) creates
    productive conflict over risk assessment and hidden agendas
  
  GROUNDING:
  - Joe provides institutional memory and precedent
  - Vic demands evidence and proof
  - Samir focuses on operational reality and failure modes
  
  EXPLORATION:
  - Tammy maps systems and second-order effects
  - Frankie surfaces opportunities and value conflicts
  - Maya reveals hidden assumptions and political dynamics
  
  CONSENSUS POTENTIAL:
  - Multiple medium-risk members (Joe, Vic, Samir) can bridge perspectives
  - Diverse epistemologies prevent premature agreement
  - Operational focus (Samir) adds practical grounding
  
  BLIND SPOT COVERAGE:
  ✓ Political/hidden agenda (Maya)
  ✓ Value conflicts/opportunities (Frankie)
  ✓ Precedent/history (Joe)
  ✓ Evidence/proof (Vic)
  ✓ Systems/consequences (Tammy)
  ✓ Operational reality (Samir)
