# 🏛️ MG: The Governance Laboratory

> *"You are looking at a repo that seems to be about 'Adventures' and 'Rooms'. That is a disguise. This project is actually about Governance of Synthetic Intelligence."*

## 🔎 The Purpose

**MG**  is the laboratory where we design the **Social Architecture** of Artificial Intelligence.

While the `kernel` handles the *technical* operating system (files, drivers, memory), `mg` handles the *political* operating system:
*   **Who decides** what code gets run? (Propensities & Committees)
*   **How do they decide?** (Debates & Rubrics)
*   **How do we verify?** (Adversarial Review)

## 📂 The Architecture of Governance

The directory structure mirrors the components of a functional government:

### 1. The Electorate (`/characters`)
We don't just write "personas"; we design **Adversarial Agents**.
*   Every character has explicit **Propensities** (`risk_tolerance`, `epistemology`, `blind_spots`).
*   This ensures diversity of thought, preventing "Symcophantic Collapse" in debates.

### 2. The Legislature (`/scenarios`)
Where the agents meet to deliberate and decide.
*   **Debates**: Structured arguments with binding resolutions (e.g., `source-code-organization`).
*   **Consultations**: Design reviews (e.g., `brain2`).
*   **Simulations**: "Soup House" experiments in spatial cooperation.

### 3. The Judiciary (`/rubrics`)
The laws by which agents are judged.
*   `character-rubric.md`: Are the agents complex enough to be trusted?
*   `editorial-rubric.yml`: Did the debate actually solve the problem?

### 4. The Archives (`/copilot`)
The institutional memory and "Captain's Logs".
*   Contains handoffs, continuity signals, and the true history of the project's intent.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Lab

1.  **Form a Committee:** Use `characters/` to select agents with opposing propensities.
2.  **Convene a Scenario:** Create a directory in `scenarios/` (use `.template-SCENARIO.yml`).
3.  **Run the Protocol:** Execute the debate/review using the behaviors defined in `BEHAVIORS.md`.
4.  **Ratify the Output:** The result isn't just text; it's a decision that guides the `kernel` implementation.

*This directory is a prototype for the "Federalist Model" of AI development, where distinct "Worlds" (States) are governed by local rules, while respecting the immutable "Kernel" (Federal Constitution).*
