charter:
  goal: "Define the strategy for source code organization to enable user creativity while preserving core stability."
  
  context: |
    The current codebase mixes core skills and user content. We need a structure 
    that allows users to keep their worlds/adventures separate from core skills, 
    facilitating updates and sharing.
    
  success_criteria:
    - Clear boundary definition between "Core" and "User"
    - Mechanism for user content to exist independently
    - Plan for handling dependencies between user content and core
    
  exit_conditions:
    - A consensus decision on the directory structure
    - A set of recommended changes to the repo layout
    
  deliverable_format: "Resolution Artifact (YAML)"
