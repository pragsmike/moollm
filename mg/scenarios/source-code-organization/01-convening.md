# Phase 1: Convening

**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Selection Strategy:** Balanced (FORM-SMART)

## Selection Rationale

Selected using balanced strategy for deeper exploration:
- Core 5-member pattern (paranoid_realism, idealism, continuity_guardian, evidence_prosecutor, systems_thinking) ensures maximum diversity
- Added operational_realism for operational depth and reality checking
- All 6 members have unique propensity types, epistemologies, and debate roles
- Balanced risk tolerance: 1 low, 1 high, 4 medium/varies
- Ensures comprehensive exploration while maintaining consensus capability

## Composition Notes

This balanced committee provides:

**TENSION:**
- Maya (paranoid, low risk) vs. Frankie (idealist, high risk) creates productive conflict over risk assessment and hidden agendas

**GROUNDING:**
- Joe provides institutional memory and precedent
- Vic demands evidence and proof
- Samir focuses on operational reality and failure modes

**EXPLORATION:**
- Tammy maps systems and second-order effects
- Frankie surfaces opportunities and value conflicts
- Maya reveals hidden assumptions and political dynamics

**CONSENSUS POTENTIAL:**
- Multiple medium-risk members (Joe, Vic, Samir) can bridge perspectives
- Diverse epistemologies prevent premature agreement
- Operational focus (Samir) adds practical grounding

**BLIND SPOT COVERAGE:**
- ✓ Political/hidden agenda (Maya)
- ✓ Value conflicts/opportunities (Frankie)
- ✓ Precedent/history (Joe)
- ✓ Evidence/proof (Vic)
- ✓ Systems/consequences (Tammy)
- ✓ Operational reality (Samir)
