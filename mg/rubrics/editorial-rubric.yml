# SCORING CRITERIA
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  criteria:
  
    # 1. STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT (Score by: Editorial Chief)
    strategic_alignment:
      weight: 0.25
      scale: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      description: "Does the Resolution directly answer the Charter's core question?"
      critical: true
      anchors:
        5: "Perfect alignment. Answers the question precisely and advances the mission."
        4: "Strong alignment. Minor deviations but fundamentally sound."
        3: "Acceptable. Answers the letter of the request but maybe not the spirit."
        2: "Drift. Solves a different problem than the one asked."
        1: "Failure. Does not address the Charter at all."

    # 2. EVIDENCE & VERIFICATION (Score by: Fact Checker)
    evidence_verification:
      weight: 0.25
      scale: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      description: "Are all claims supported by citable evidence or data?"
      critical: true
      anchors:
        5: "Ironclad. Every claim cited. No hallucinations."
        4: "Solid. Most claims cited. Minor assumptions flagged."
        3: "Mixed. Key claims supported, but some 'common knowledge' assumptions."
        2: "Weak. Relies heavily on assertion without proof."
        1: "Fiction. Claims are demonstrably false or completely uncited."

    # 3. LOGICAL RIGOR (Score by: Logic Auditor)
    logical_rigor:
      weight: 0.25
      scale: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      description: "Is the internal argument valid? Do premises lead to conclusions?"
      critical: true
      anchors:
        5: "Valid. The decision tree is flawless. No fallacies."
        4: "Sound. Minor skipped steps but the core logic holds."
        3: "Fuzzy. Rhetoric is doing some heavy lifting, but not fatal."
        2: "Fallacious. Contains contradictions or non-sequiturs."
        1: "Incoherent. The Rationale contradicts the Decision."

    # 4. STAKEHOLDER IMPACT (Score by: Ombudsman)
    stakeholder_impact:
      weight: 0.25
      scale: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      description: "Are negative externalities identified and mitigated?"
      critical: false # Can pass with low impact score if strategic need is high, but needs critique
      anchors:
        5: "Excellent. Impact fully analyzed, mitigation plan included."
        4: "Good. Impact identified, some mitigation proposed."
        3: "Adequate. Impact mentioned but understated."
        2: "Blind. Significant negative impact ignored."
        1: "Hostile. Actively harmful to stakeholders without acknowledgment."
