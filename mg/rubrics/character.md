# 🎯 Character Sheet Rubric for Debate Participation

## Purpose

This rubric scores character sheets to determine how effective they will be as participants in adversarial committee debates. **High scores indicate characters that, when combined with complementary temperaments, will produce structured, comprehensive, and productive debates.**

- **2** = Adequate, meets basic requirements
- **3** = Strong, well-defined
- **4** = Excellent, exemplary

## Scoring Guidelines

### Individual Character Score
Score each character on criteria 1-21 (84 points max for individual character).

### Team Composition Score
Score criteria 22-25 (16 points) based on how the character fits with others in a specific team composition.

### Total Score
- **90-100**: Excellent debate participant
- **75-89**: Strong debate participant
- **60-74**: Adequate, but could be improved
- **45-59**: Weak, needs significant improvement
- **<45**: Not suitable for debate scenarios

---

## Notes

- **Complementary temperaments** are key—a character that scores 100 alone might score lower if the team already has similar perspectives.
- **Tension is productive**—characters should conflict, not just agree.
- **Specificity matters**—vague characters produce vague debates.
- **Balance matters**—teams need diverse perspectives, not just strong individuals.
