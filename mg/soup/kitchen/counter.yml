    A clean counter with good lighting and plenty of workspace. This is
    where you put things you're actively using - taken from the fridge
    or pantry and ready to work with.

    The counter is clear except for a few items laid out for use. A cutting
    board sits ready. Unlike storage, everything here is meant to be touched.
