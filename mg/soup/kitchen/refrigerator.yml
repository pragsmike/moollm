    A humming refrigerator with a freezer compartment on top. This is where
    you store resources that have a shelf life - API keys that expire,
    trial licenses, time-limited access, cached data that goes stale.

  examine: |
    The refrigerator door has a few magnets holding notes. Inside, shelves
    are labeled by expiration urgency: SOON, LATER, FROZEN.
