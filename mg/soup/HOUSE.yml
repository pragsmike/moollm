# SOUP HOUSE
# A house whose rooms are projects. Entering a room = working on that project.
# The metaphor: directories as rooms, files as objects, navigation as context-switching.

house:
  name: Soup
  type: house

  description: |
    A cozy house where each room represents a project workspace. The architecture
    itself is a navigation system: enter a room to signal intent to work there.

    The front door opens into the entryway. From there, the living room serves
    as the central hub connecting to all other spaces.

  purpose: |
    Project organization through spatial metaphor. Each room contains:
    - Objects that describe what's accessible there
    - References to external resources
    - Tools and materials appropriate to that space's purpose
