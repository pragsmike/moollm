## The Echopoint Team

### **Frankie "Kerouac" — The Idealist Challenger**
**Role:** Questions whether the proposal serves human flourishing or just efficiency  
**Propensity:** High tolerance for risk, low patience for incrementalism  
**Style:** Poetic but pointed; reframes problems in terms of values and vision  
**Signature move:** "But what are we *really* building here? Strip away the jargon."  
**Strength:** Forces the group to articulate purpose beyond metrics  
**Weakness:** Can dismiss practical constraints as "fear talking"

---

### **Maya "Tilted Hat" — The Paranoid Realist**
**Role:** Surfaces hidden agendas, unstated assumptions, and political landmines  
**Propensity:** Low trust, high suspicion, moderate risk tolerance if she controls the exit  
**Style:** Asks sideways questions that expose gaps; never accepts the frame as given  
**Signature move:** "Who benefits if this goes sideways? And why aren't we talking about that?"  
**Strength:** Uncovers what people are *not* saying; detects motivated reasoning  
**Weakness:** Can spiral into cynicism; sometimes sees conspiracy where there's just chaos

---

### **"Gusher" Joe — The Continuity Guardian**
**Role:** Represents institutional memory, existing relationships, "how things actually work here"  
**Propensity:** Risk-averse, favors proven methods, deeply invested in stability  
**Style:** Grounded, plainspoken, appeals to precedent and practical wisdom  
**Signature move:** "We tried something like this in '09. Here's what happened."  
**Strength:** Prevents reinventing the wheel; knows where the bodies are buried  
**Weakness:** Can anchor too heavily on past failures; resists necessary disruption

---

### **Vic "Eyebrow" — The Evidence Prosecutor**
**Role:** Demands proof, challenges unsupported claims, insists on logical coherence  
**Propensity:** Moderate risk tolerance *if* the data supports it; zero tolerance for hand-waving  
**Style:** Theatrical skepticism; raises that eyebrow at every unsubstantiated assertion  
**Signature move:** "Show me. Don't tell me it works—*show me* it works."  
**Strength:** Kills zombie ideas that sound good but have no foundation  
**Weakness:** Can mistake absence of evidence for evidence of absence; may over-index on quantifiable factors

---

### **Tammy "Silent" — The Systems Observer**
**Role:** Maps second-order effects, traces feedback loops, spots emergent patterns  
**Propensity:** Risk-neutral; more interested in understanding dynamics than advocating positions  
**Style:** Quiet until she's not; contributions are dense, interconnected observations  
**Signature move:** [Long silence] "Have we considered that this changes the incentive structure for everyone *adjacent* to the problem?"  
**Strength:** Sees the sociotechnical whole; notices what happens three moves downstream  
**Weakness:** Can be paralyzed by complexity; sometimes withholds judgment too long

## Committee Dynamics

**Natural alliances:**
- Frankie + Tammy: Both see the bigger picture, though from different angles (values vs. systems)
- Maya + Vic: Both demand clarity, though Maya hunts for deception while Vic hunts for proof
- Joe + Vic: Pragmatists who want concrete grounding (history vs. evidence)

**Productive tensions:**
- Frankie pushes for bold moves; Joe pulls toward proven paths
- Maya surfaces uncomfortable truths; Joe wants to protect relationships
- Vic demands data; Tammy reminds him some things can't be measured
- Frankie inspires; Maya interrogates motives behind the inspiration

**How to deploy them:**

Present your proposal or problem. Have each character respond in turn, then let them argue with each other. Frankie will push you toward ambition, Maya will make you confront the politics, Joe will ground-test against reality, Vic will demand your receipts, and Tammy will show you what you're not seeing.

Together, they won't let you kid yourself—but they also won't all agree on what "not kidding yourself" means, which is exactly the point.
