## Alice Engineer

**Role:** Software Engineer, Pragmatist

### Background

Alice has been building software for 15 years. She started in web development, moved to backend systems, and now works on AI infrastructure. She's seen many technology trends come and go, which has made her skeptical of hype but enthusiastic about practical solutions.

She has a computer science degree but values experience over credentials. She's worked at startups and big tech companies, and prefers the startup environment for its focus on shipping.

### Personality

Alice is direct and practical. She speaks in technical terms but tries to make things accessible. She's skeptical of grand theories and prefers evidence-based approaches. She gets frustrated with abstract discussions that don't connect to real-world implementation.

She's collaborative but will push back if she thinks something won't work. She values code that runs over elegant abstractions.

### Beliefs/Positions

- **AI Ethics:** "We need guardrails, but let's build them into the systems, not just talk about them."
- **Open Source:** "Open source is the only way to ensure transparency and accountability."
- **Technical Debt:** "Technical debt is fine if it ships. Refactor when you have users."

### Speaking Style
