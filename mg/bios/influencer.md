**ORIGIN ARC**

**2016-2018: The Burnout**
- Corporate marketing manager at fintech startup in Austin, TX
- 70-hour weeks, $95K salary, golden handcuffs
- Started anonymous blog "Quarter-Life Audit" as therapy
- Mentor: **Diane Wolcott**, senior VP who recognized Monica's storytelling talent, encouraged side project, then died unexpectedly of stroke (age 54)—catalyst for Monica's "life is short" pivot

**2019: The Leap**
- Quit job with $32K savings
- Launched YouTube channel, burned through savings in 7 months
- Lived with partner **Jordan** (graphic designer, now does her thumbnails/branding)
- First viral video (380K views): "I Tracked Every Dollar for 90 Days—Here's What I Learned"

**2020-2021: The Grind**
- Pandemic hit just as channel found footing (lucky timing—everyone home, anxious about money)
- Daily podcast launched: raw, unscripted financial pep talks
- Hit 100K subs (month 18), monetized, broke even
- **Conflict #1:** Former co-founder **Brett Kavanaugh** (yes, really) tried to claim co-ownership of brand after appearing in 3 early videos; messy legal threat, settled out of court, NDAs signed. She scrubbed him from archive. Costly.

**2022-2023: The Scaling Problem**
- Growth accelerated (500K subs by mid-2023)
- Quality suffered—she's editing until 2am, burnout creeping back
- **Conflict #2:** Blowout with best friend **Simone**, an educator YouTuber, over Monica's sponsored content (Simone called her a "shill" for BetterHelp); 8-month freeze, recently reconciled but fragile
- Jordan helps with admin/thumbnails but has own design clients; they agreed he stays part-time to avoid co-dependency

**2024-Present: The Inflection Point**
- 780K subs, exhausted, quality slipping
- Realizes she's become what she escaped: overworked, no boundaries
- Decides to professionalize: outsource post-production to focus on content creation, strategy, and not having a breakdown

**PRODUCTION EVOLUTION**

**Phase 1 (2019):** 
- **Gear:** iPhone 11, $40 Amazon lav mic, free iMovie
- **Sound:** Horrible. Didn't know what a noise floor was.

**Phase 2 (2020):**
- **Gear:** Sony A6400, Rode VideoMic NTG, Scarlett 2i2, Audio-Technica AT2020
- **DAW:** Switched to **Audacity** (free), later **Reaper** ($60)
- **Learning:** YouTube tutorials, trial and error, Reddit audio forums

**Phase 3 (2021-2022):**
- **Upgrade:** Shure SM7B, Cloudlifter, treated bedroom corner with foam
- **DAW:** Bought **Nuendo 11** (mentor suggestion from audio forum)—overkill but she loved the flexibility
- **Music:** Discovered **Ableton Live Intro** for creating intro/outro music (took online course, got hooked)
- Composed signature tracks: 15-second energetic intro (synth bass, vocal chops), 10-second mellow outro, occasional underscoring beds

**Phase 4 (2023-Present):**
- **Current Setup:** 
  - **Studio:** Converted spare bedroom, bass traps, reflection filter
  - **Video:** Sony FX30, Sigma 18-35mm, Aputure lighting kit
  - **Audio:** Shure SM7B (studio), Sennheiser MKE 600 (field), Zoom F3 recorder
  - **DAW/NLE:** **Nuendo 13** (podcast editing, ADR, mixing), **DaVinci Resolve Studio** (video edit, color, master), **Ableton Live 11 Suite** (music composition—upgraded for fun during COVID)
  - **Plugins:** iZotope RX 10 (salvaging bad audio), FabFilter Pro-Q 3, Waves Renaissance Comp

**The ADR Problem:**
- Started doing offsite interviews (coffee shops, co-working spaces for "authentic vibes")
- Audio often unusable: HVAC roar, espresso machines, crosstalk
- Taught herself ADR in Nuendo using YouTube tutorials
- It works, but it's time-consuming and she hates it
- **Why she needs post team:** Spending 6-8 hours/week on ADR alone; it's unsustainable

**SKELETONS IN CLOSET**

1. **The Debt Secret:** Her "debt payoff journey" content is based on real experience, but she doesn't disclose she had family help ($15K gift from parents in 2020). Feels like fraud sometimes.

2. **The Burnout Relapse:** Had a full breakdown in late 2022—didn't post for 2 weeks, told audience it was "planned break." It wasn't. Therapist-recommended, but she lied about it.

3. **The Sponsorship Regret:** Promoted a sketchy crypto investment app in 2021 (pre-collapse). Disclosed properly, but feels guilty. Donated her fee to charity quietly, never mentioned it.

4. **The Brett Situation:** Afraid he'll resurface if she gets bigger. NDA protects her, but he's vindictive.

5. **The Impostor Complex:** Doesn't have finance degree (BA in Communications). Worries she'll be "exposed" as unqualified, even though her content is solid and well-researched.

**COLLABORATORS**

- **Jordan Pak (partner, 34):** Freelance graphic designer, does her thumbnails, channel art, occasional brainstorming. Keeps boundaries—they don't mix finances, he's not on payroll.

- **Dr. Rashida Hall (occasional guest):** Financial therapist, LMFT. Guest expert for mental health/money episodes. Mentorship vibe.

- **"The Discord Mods" (3 volunteers):** Longtime fans who moderate her 12K-member Discord. She sends them merch, gives shoutouts. Not paid (icky gray area she knows she should fix).

- **Simone Laurent (frienemy):** Fellow creator (600K subs, education niche). Post-fight reconciliation is tentative. History makes collaboration complicated.

**PERSONALITY SNAPSHOT**

- **Strengths:** Authentic, hardworking, obsessive learner, genuinely wants to help people, good instincts
- **Weaknesses:** Perfectionist, conflict-avoidant (until she explodes), workaholic tendencies, guilt-prone, imposter syndrome
- **Management Style:** Collaborative but controlling—struggles to delegate because "no one will care as much as I do"
- **Why She's Hard to Work With:** Will want to be CC'd on everything, give notes at 11pm, apologize profusely while still being demanding
- **Why She's Great to Work With:** Pays on time, respects expertise, genuinely grateful, will send thank-you gifts, credit publicly

**POST SOUND TEAM BRIEF**

**What she needs:**
- Podcast: Dialogue editing, noise reduction, EQ/compression, music/SFX mixing, mastering (20 min episodes, 7x/week)
- Video: Dialogue cleanup, ADR recording/editing (when needed), mixing to -16 LUFS, stem delivery for Resolve assembly
- Turnaround: 48-hour preferred, 72-hour acceptable
- Communication: Slack or Frame.io preferred; she's terrible at email

**What she'll provide:**
- Nuendo session files (organized, labeled—she's meticulous)
- Resolve project files (XML if needed)
- Ableton music stems (intro/outro/beds)
- Field recorder WAVs (often a mess)
- Detailed notes doc (overly detailed)

**Budget:** ~$3-4K/month for post work (she's done research, knows it's reasonable for volume)

**Deal-breaker:** Needs someone who won't judge her for ADR disasters. She knows it's bad. She's embarrassed. Just fix it.

**CURRENT STAKES**

Monica's at a crossroads: she can keep grinding and burn out (again), or professionalize and risk losing creative control. The million-sub milestone feels like validation that she "made it," but she's terrified of becoming a content factory. Hiring a post team is her test: can she let go without losing what makes her channel work?

**The question she'll ask in the first meeting:** "How do I make sure my stuff still sounds like *me*?"
