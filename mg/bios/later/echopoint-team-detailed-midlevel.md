# The Echopoint Team: The "Experienced Outsiders"

## Frankie "Kerouac" Rodriguez — The Street-Level Idealist

**Age:** 25 | **Role:** Creative Lead & Co-founder
**Archetype:** The eternal apprentice with a punk ethos.

### Background
Frankie grew up in Oakland, dragging a beat-up guitar case between bus stops. He formed three bands in high school, none of which survived more than a year, but he was always the one figuring out how to record them on a cassette deck. He learned sound not as a science, but as a survival mechanism for live performance.

### Education
- **BA in Communications (incomplete)**, Cal State East Bay (Dropped out Junior year).
- **"University of Youtube"**: Has watched every single tutorial on compression, EQ, and limiting ever uploaded.
- **Mentorship under local club engineers**: Learned by buying them beers and asking why the kick drum sounded like cardboard.

### Work History
- **Busker/Street Performer (2018-2020):** Played on BART platforms and street corners. Learned how to manage acoustics in terrible spaces (tiled tunnels, windy corners) using battery-powered amps.
- **A2 / Stage Hand, "The Velvet Lounge" (2020-2022):** A small 200-cap rock club. He coiled cables, placed mics, and patched the stage. Occasionally allowed to mix monitors for opening acts when the main guy was on a smoke break.
- **Shadow/Assistant to FOH Engineer (2022-Present):** Works under a grumpy touring engineer for mid-level indie bands. He sets the compressors and reverbs during soundcheck under strict supervision ("Don't touch the threshold, kid, just the release").
- **Freelance Podcast Editor (Sporadic):** Edits local comedy podcasts for $50 an episode.

### Mentors
- **"Big Sal"**, The Velvet Lounge's head sound guy: Taught him that "if it sounds good, it is good," and that gear doesn't matter if the band sucks.
- **His older sister**: A union organizer who taught him that being "the help" doesn't mean you don't have power.

### Successes
- Once saved a show when the main digital console crashed by hot-patching a backup analog mixer in under 3 minutes.
- His own band’s demo, which he mixed in a closet, got played on local college radio.
- Convinced a venue owner to treat the back wall with acoustic foam he scavenged from a dumpster, measurably improving the room's sound.

### Failures
- Got fired from a corporate AV gig for arguing with a client about their "soulless" background music choice.
- Blew a monitor wedge during a show because he didn't understand gain staging on a new board.
- Has a chip on his shoulder about "studio guys" that makes him defensive when talking about technical specs.

### Why He's Here
Frankie is tired of asking for permission to touch the faders. He has the ear and the passion, but the "gatekeepers" keep him coiling cables. He sees Echopoint as his stage—a place where he can finally prove that his street-level instincts are worth more than a degree.

## Maya "Tilted Hat" Chen — The Gatekeeper

**Age:** 29 | **Role:** Business Operations & Co-founder
**Archetype:** The executive assistant who actually ran the show.

### Background
Born in Queens, Maya was the oldest daughter who handled all the household paperwork for her immigrant parents. She learned early that forms, deadlines, and fine print were weapons that could be used for or against you.

### Education
- **BS in Business Administration**, CUNY Hunter College (2016).
- **Notary Public**: Got certified just so she wouldn't have to rely on anyone else to legalize a document.

### Work History
- **Receptionist, Talent Agency (2016-2018):** The first line of defense. Learned to spot a liar in 10 seconds. Managed the calendars of three agents who couldn't manage themselves.
- **Executive Assistant to a Music Producer (2018-2021):** The producer was a chaotic genius; Maya was the infrastructure. She booked the flights, chased the invoices, lied to the labels about delivery dates, and essentially managed his entire life. She saw every contract but never negotiated one herself.
- **Freelance Virtual Assistant (2021-Present):** Manages administrative tasks for several creative freelancers. She builds their invoices and nags them to pay their taxes.

### Mentors
- **Sarah Jenkins**, the Senior EA at the agency: Taught her the "pocket veto"—how to "accidentally" lose a bad memo until it’s too late to matter.
- **Her father**: Who taught her, "In this country, paper is stronger than stone."

### Successes
- Recovered $15,000 in unpaid royalties for her former boss by digging through three years of poorly filed emails.
- Created a color-coded scheduling system that stopped her producer boss from double-booking sessions for six straight months.
- Has a "black book" of contacts (caterers, drivers, rental houses) that she guards with her life.

### Failures
- Burned out spectacularly from the producer job; she quit without a backup plan because she couldn't take the 3 AM phone calls.
- Struggled to set boundaries with her freelance clients, often working for free to "fix" their messes.
- Has never managed a P&L statement for a company, only personal expense reports.

### Why She's Here
Maya knows she has the skills to run a business because she’s been running other people's lives for a decade. She’s tired of being the "assistant" to chaotic men. Echopoint is her chance to build a structure that *she* controls, where organization is valued as much as "creative genius."

## Joe "Gusher" Castellano — The Reluctant Veteran

**Age:** 43 | **Role:** Client Relations & Co-founder
**Archetype:** The career journeyman who fears the spotlight.

### Background
Joe grew up in the San Fernando Valley. He wasn't a prodigy; he was just a guy who needed a job. He fell into audio because his cousin needed help loading a truck for a gig in 1998 and Joe was strong. He stayed because he liked the darkness of the wings.

### Education
- **High School Diploma**.
- **Associate's in General Studies**, Community College (never used it).
- **Certifications**: Forklift certified, CPR certified, Rigging Level 1.

### Work History
- **Stage Hand / Loader (2000-2010):** The muscle. Pushed cases, hung truss, focused lights. Reliable, on time, sober.
- **A2 (Audio Assistant), Regional Theater & Events (2010-2018):** The guy who mics the actors and troubleshoots the RF (radio frequencies). He’s the one crouching in the dark fixing a battery pack while the show goes on. He’s great at it.
- **FOH Engineer, Small Clubs/Weddings (2018-Present):** started mixing small bands and corporate talking heads. He’s competent—he can make a room sound clean—but he lacks the "artistic ego" to push for a bold mix. He plays it safe.

### Mentors
- **"Old Man Miller"**, a union steward: Taught Joe that "Safety is job one, getting paid is job two, the show is job three."
- **A touring FOH engineer** he shadowed in 2015: Showed him that mixing is 90% psychology and 10% EQ.

### Successes
- Has never missed a cue in 20 years.
- During a corporate event, the CEO's mic died; Joe swapped it out in 4 seconds flat, invisible to the audience. The client still requests him by name.
- Has a reputation as the "nicest guy in the venue." Bands love him because he brings them water and actually checks their monitor levels.

### Failures
- Turned down a chance to tour as A1 for a rising band because he was terrified of messing it up. The band is huge now.
- Often undercharges for his work because he doesn't think he's "pro" enough.
- Struggles with modern digital networking (Dante, AVB); he misses analog snakes.

### Why He's Here
Joe knows he has hit the ceiling of "A2 life." He’s getting too old to crawl under stages. He has the technical chops and the client skills, but he needs a push. He sees Echopoint as a way to transition into a "real business" where he can use his reliability without destroying his knees. He needs Frankie’s vision to believe in himself.

## Victor "Vic 'Eyebrow'" Okonkwo — The Hobbyist Expert

**Age:** 33 | **Role:** Technical Director & Co-founder
**Archetype:** The engineer who moonlights as an audiophile.

### Background
Vic grew up in Maryland, taking apart radios and putting them back together. He didn't care about the music; he cared about the signal. He views audio as a math problem waiting to be solved.

### Education
- **BS in Electrical Engineering**, Georgia Tech (2014).
- **Self-Taught**: Has read the manual for every DAW, plugin, and interface in existence. Twice.

### Work History
- **Systems Engineer, Telecom Company (2014-Present):** His day job. He designs network infrastructure. It pays the bills and requires extreme precision.
- **"The Gear Head" (Nights/Weekends):** Spends his free time building DIY preamps, soldering cables, and beta-testing audio plugins for developers he meets on forums.
- **Studio Hanger-On:** Befriended a few high-end mastering engineers online. They let him sit in on sessions because he can fix their computer problems. He absorbs their techniques while fixing their drivers.

### Mentors
- **Dr. Aris**, his signals processing professor: Taught him the Fourier Transform and how to see sound as math.
- **A famous mastering engineer (Internet friend)**: Who told Vic, "You know more about how this plugin works than I do, but I know how to use it."

### Successes
- Built a custom patch bay for a local studio that eliminated a hum they’d been fighting for years.
- Wrote a script that automates file naming for a post-production house (as a favor), saving them hours of work.
- His home "lab" is acoustically flatter than most pro studios, a fact he is very proud of.

### Failures
- Has zero "bedside manner." He once told a singer her take was "statistically pitch-imperfect" and ruined the vibe.
- Has never charged money for audio work; he’s always done it for trade or fun. He has no idea how to price a service.
- Can get stuck in "analysis paralysis," spending 4 hours A/B testing cables instead of recording.

### Why He's Here
Vic is bored by his telecom job. He wants to apply his rigorous engineering brain to a field that is full of "voodoo and superstition." He respects the team because they are "data points" he doesn't have—Frankie has the art, Joe has the practicals. He wants to build the machine that lets them perform.

## Tammy "Silent" Park — The Manager

**Age:** 37 | **Role:** Strategic Planning & Co-founder
**Archetype:** The only adult in the room.

### Background
Tammy is from New Jersey. She is quiet, observant, and ruthlessly efficient. While the others were dreaming of rock stardom or analyzing waveforms, Tammy was organizing the school fundraiser and optimizing the seating chart.

### Education
- **BA in Sociology**, Rutgers University (2010).
- **PMP (Project Management Professional)** certification.

### Work History
- **Office Manager, Logistics Firm (2012-2018):** Ran a warehouse office. Managed payroll, HR disputes, inventory, and a team of 15 drivers. Learned how to manage people who hate being managed.
- **Operations Director, Mid-Sized Insurance Brokerage (2018-2023):** The only "significant leadership" role on the team. She streamlined claims processing, hired and fired staff, and reported directly to the partners.
- **Layoff Victim (2023):** The firm was bought out, and she was made redundant. She took a severance package and some time off to figure out what she actually liked.

### Mentors
- **Her first boss at the warehouse**: A tough-as-nails woman who taught Tammy, "Don't raise your voice. Just wait until they stop talking, then tell them what to do."
- **The concept of 'Kaizen'**: Continuous improvement. She applies it to everything, including her kitchen pantry.

### Successes
- Reduced overhead at the insurance firm by 15% just by renegotiating vendor contracts (paper, toner, coffee).
- Successfully mediated a potential lawsuit between two employees by documenting everything.
- Is the only person on the team who knows how to set up an LLC, register for taxes, and run payroll.

### Failures
- Has zero creative background. She doesn't know what a "stem" is and thinks a "bus" is a vehicle.
- Can be rigid. She struggles when the "process" needs to be broken for a creative emergency.
- Is secretly terrified that she's "boring" compared to the artists she now works with.

### Why She's Here
Tammy met Maya at a networking event for displaced workers. She doesn't care about audio; she cares about *systems*. She sees Echopoint as a fascinating puzzle: a chaotic creative endeavor that desperately needs order. She joins because she wants to build a company culture from scratch, one that isn't toxic like her corporate gigs. Plus, she knows that without her, these guys will be bankrupt in three months.

## Team Formation Story: "The Generator Incident"

They didn't meet at a sleek Hollywood mixer. They met in the mud, at a DIY outdoor music festival in Silver Lake that Frankie organized in 2024 called "Eco-Noise."

**The Spark:** Frankie had a vision for a sustainable, solar-powered music festival. He had the bands, the passion, and absolutely no logistical plan. Two hours before doors, the solar generator failed, and the permit officer arrived.

**The Pragmatist:** Joe was working at the rental house where Frankie rented the PA. He had warned Frankie the generator was too small. When Frankie called him in a panic, Joe drove over with a backup gas generator (against policy) and stayed to run the board because he couldn't bear to watch the kids fail.

**The Skeptic:** Vic was actually attending the festival as a fan of one of the obscurity noise bands. He wandered over to the tech tent when he heard a 60-cycle hum that was driving him insane. He saw Joe and Frankie struggling with a grounding issue, pulled a soldering iron out of his backpack (which he carries everywhere), and fixed the cable on the spot. He stayed because he wanted to explain to them exactly why their gain staging was mathematically inefficient.

**The Realist:** Maya had been hired by Frankie via a gig app to "handle the door." Within 20 minutes, she realized there was no cash box, no list, and no wristbands. She commandeered a folding table, created a digital ticketing system on her phone, and successfully stalled the permit officer by burying him in irrelevant paperwork until the headliner finished.

**The Observer:** Tammy was Maya's friend from a "Post-Layoff Support Group." She came to support Maya but spent the entire time organizing the band merchandise table because the mess was giving her anxiety. By the end of the night, she had a ledger of every dollar spent and earned.

**The Aftermath:**
They ended the night exhausted, muddy, and $400 in the hole. But they realized something: Frankie had the vision to get people there. Joe kept the sound running. Vic fixed the impossible tech problems. Maya kept the law away. And Tammy made sure they didn't lose *more* money.

They met for cheap tacos the next week. Frankie said, "We should do this for real." Tammy said, "Only if we have a business plan."

And Echopoint was born—not out of expertise, but out of survival.
