# The Echopoint Team: Full Character Dossiers

## Frankie "Kerouac" Rodriguez — The Idealist Challenger

**Age:** 29 | **Role:** Creative Director & Co-founder

### Background
Frankie grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Oakland, the child of a union organizer mother and a high school English teacher father. Dinner table conversations oscillated between labor politics and beat poetry. He absorbed both.

### Education
- BA in Film & Media Studies, San Francisco State University (2018)
- Never finished graduate school—dropped out of West Coast Film Academy's Peter Stark Producing Program after one semester, calling it "an MBA for people who want to make art but are afraid to say so"
- Self-educated through a ferocious reading habit: critical theory, design philosophy, counterculture manifestos

### Work History
- **Sound intern, Skybound Sound** (2018-2019): Made coffee, organized cables, absorbed everything. Watched Ben Barrett work on a documentary project and had an epiphany about sound as storytelling.
- **Junior sound editor, boutique commercial house** (2019-2021): Learned the craft, hated the commercialism. Quit dramatically after a creative disagreement about a car commercial, burning a bridge with the owner.
- **Freelance sound designer** (2021-2023): Built a small reputation doing low-budget indie features and podcasts. Worked on one breakout narrative podcast that got festival attention but no money.
- **Brief stint at a tech company's audio branding division** (2023): Lasted four months. Left because "they wanted sonic logos, not sonic meaning."

### Mentors
- **Carmen Vasquez**, documentary sound mixer: Taught Frankie that sound work is political—that choosing what to amplify is choosing what matters. They still get coffee monthly.
- **His father, indirectly**: Instilled the idea that work should serve something larger than yourself.

### Successes
- That one podcast series won "Best Sound Design" at Tribeca Festival's audio storytelling program
- Built a small but devoted following on social media for essays about "sound ethics"
- Successfully pitched the Echopoint concept to the rest of the team by connecting it to values, not just business opportunity

### Failures
- The dramatic quit at the commercial house created a reputation as "difficult" in some circles
- A collaboration with a visual artist fell apart when Frankie insisted on credit parity and the artist refused
- Tendency to start projects with grand manifestos, then struggle with follow-through on administrative details
- Has never made more than $42K in a single year

### Why He's Here
Frankie sees Echopoint as a chance to build the thing he's been circling around for years: a company where the work matters, where creative integrity isn't a negotiable expense, where efficiency serves art rather than replacing it. He knows he can't do it alone—he needs people who understand spreadsheets, contracts, practical reality. But someone needs to hold the vision, and that's him.

## Maya "Tilted Hat" Chen — The Paranoid Realist

**Age:** 34 | **Role:** Business Operations & Co-founder

### Background
Grew up in a first-generation immigrant household in Queens. Her parents ran a small garment manufacturing business that got squeezed out by larger contractors who played games with payment terms and contracts. She watched her father lose everything while trusting handshake deals. Learned early: get it in writing, and assume everyone has an angle.

### Education
- BA in Economics, CUNY Baruch College (2013)
- Certificate in Audio Engineering, Boston Music Conservatory Online (2018)—done while working full-time, because she wanted to understand the technical side before anyone could snow her

### Work History
- **Assistant to the producer, mid-sized post house** (2013-2016): Saw how deals really got made. Watched producers promise things to clients they couldn't deliver, then blame the crew. Took mental notes.
- **Production coordinator** (2016-2019): Moved up by being the person who actually read contracts and caught billing errors. Saved the company $60K in one year by auditing vendor invoices. Got a $500 bonus and no raise.
- **Operations manager, boutique audio post facility** (2019-2022): Finally had some authority. Implemented systems, protected the team from scope creep, learned to say "no" to clients. Built a reputation as tough but fair.
- **Independent consultant** (2022-2023): Helped small creative companies set up operational infrastructure. Discovered she was good at seeing structural problems others missed.

### Mentors
- **Richard Nakamura**, former boss at the mid-sized post house: A rare honest broker who taught her that "paranoia in business isn't a bug, it's risk management." Retired now, but she still calls him for advice.
- **Her mother**: Who said, after the business failed, "Next time, trust no one until they earn it. And even then, verify."

### Successes
- Negotiated a contract revision that saved her former company from a disastrous licensing agreement
- Built an operational playbook that three different companies have adapted
- Has never, in 10 years, been surprised by a bad client—she saw every red flag coming
- Once caught an embezzling freelance bookkeeper within two weeks of hiring them

### Failures
- Killed a potentially lucrative partnership because she couldn't get comfortable with the other party's vague answers—turned out they were legitimate, just disorganized
- Has a reputation for being "difficult" and "negative" that has cost her opportunities
- A brief romantic relationship with a colleague ended badly when she started questioning their expense reports
- Sometimes alienates potential allies by treating normal mistakes as intentional deceptions

### Why She's Here
Maya knows creative people need someone to watch their backs, especially when they're busy watching their art. She's seen too many talented people get exploited, too many good ideas fail because of bad contracts or poor planning. Echopoint is her chance to build something with the protections baked in from the start. She doesn't trust easily, but she trusts this group more than most—and that's saying something.

## Joe "Gusher" Castellano — The Continuity Guardian

**Age:** 51 | **Role:** Client Relations & Co-founder

### Background
Born and raised in Burbank, literally grew up in the shadow of the studios. His uncle was a grip, his aunt worked in post-production, his cousin did VFX. The industry wasn't glamorous—it was Tuesday. He absorbed the culture through family dinners and weekend barbecues where shop talk never stopped.

### Education
- Associate's degree in Recording Arts, Los Angeles Recording School (1994)
- "School of hard knocks after that"—a phrase he uses unironically

### Work History
- **Runner/PA, various studios** (1994-1997): Paid dues, learned the geography, made friends
- **Sound assistant, major studio post facility** (1997-2004): Worked his way up from assistant to mixer. Steady, reliable, never flashy. Survived three regime changes by being useful to everyone.
- **Re-recording mixer** (2004-2014): Had a solid decade. Worked on mid-budget features, TV shows, the occasional prestige project. Made a comfortable living. Built relationships.
- **Freelance mixer/supervisor** (2014-present): The studio consolidated and his position was eliminated. Has stayed afloat through the relationships he built over 20 years. Some months are great, some are terrifying.

### Mentors
- **Tom Fleischman** (indirectly): Worked near him at the same facility, watched him work, absorbed his philosophy of "serve the story, not your ego"
- **His uncle Frank**: Who told him, "This industry runs on relationships. Technology changes, techniques change, but people remember who showed up and did the work."

### Successes
- Worked on two Oscar-nominated films (didn't win, but still counts)
- Has maintained relationships with clients for 15+ years—they follow him from project to project
- Survived multiple industry downturns by being adaptable and reliable
- That one time in 2009 when he convinced a director to redo a problematic mix rather than release it—saved the film's reputation

### Failures
- Didn't see the studio consolidation coming, lost his staff position
- Passed on an opportunity to join a startup post house in 2011 because it seemed too risky—they're now a major player
- Has sometimes protected bad performers out of loyalty, creating team friction
- Struggles with new remote collaboration tools; still prefers in-person sessions

### Why He's Here
Joe's been freelancing for nine years and it's wearing on him. The feast-famine cycle, the constant hustle, the feeling that the industry is moving on without him. He sees Echopoint as a chance to build something stable again—not just for himself, but for the kind of mid-career professionals who are getting squeezed out. He's the person keeping this thing grounded in reality while the others dream big. Someone has to remember that this is a business, not a philosophy seminar.

## Victor "Vic 'Eyebrow'" Okonkwo — The Evidence Prosecutor

**Age:** 38 | **Role:** Technical Director & Co-founder

### Background
Grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland. His father was a statistician for the Census Bureau, his mother a chemistry teacher. Dinner conversations involved data, methodology, and his parents gently demolishing each other's assumptions. He learned that "because I said so" was never an acceptable answer.

### Education
- BS in Electrical Engineering, Georgia Tech (2009)
- MS in Music Technology, NYU Steinhardt (2011)
- Started a PhD in psychoacoustics at McGill (2012), left ABD (all but dissertation) in 2014 when he realized academia wasn't his path

### Work History
- **R&D intern, audio software company** (2011): First taste of applied audio technology. Loved it.
- **Junior engineer, audio plugin developer** (2014-2017): Built tools, learned to code, got frustrated with "golden ears" mythology in audio. Started giving conference talks about "measurable versus imagined improvements."
- **Technical consultant, various post facilities** (2017-2020): Helped companies optimize workflows, choose technology, train staff. Built a reputation as someone who could translate between engineering and creative teams.
- **Freelance technical director** (2020-present): The pandemic made everyone need someone who understood remote workflows and could prove what actually worked versus what vendors claimed.

### Mentors
- **Dr. William Martens** (former professor): Taught him that perception is real but measurable, and that subjective experience doesn't mean you abandon rigor
- **His father**: Who taught him to always ask "How do you know?" and "Show me the data"

### Successes
- Gave a viral talk at an audio conference titled "Placebo Plugins: What We Think We Hear vs. What We Actually Hear"
- Saved a major post house $200K by proving their planned technology upgrade would provide no measurable benefit
- Developed a workflow analysis tool that's now used by multiple facilities
- Successfully predicted which audio formats would actually gain industry adoption (and which were vaporware)

### Failures
- The "golden ears" talk made him enemies among some old-guard mixers who felt insulted
- Left a PhD program, which still stings—feels like unfinished business
- Has sometimes been so insistent on proof that he's delayed decisions that needed to be made
- A romantic relationship ended when his partner said he "cross-examined everything, even feelings"

### Why He's Here
Vic is tired of the audio industry running on mythology, legacy thinking, and vendor marketing. He sees Echopoint as a chance to build something based on what actually works—proven techniques, measurable results, honest client communication. He doesn't want to be a cynic; he wants to be right. And to be right, you need evidence. He knows the others think he's difficult sometimes, but he'd rather be difficult than wrong.

## Tammy "Silent" Park — The Systems Observer

**Age:** 42 | **Role:** Strategic Planning & Co-founder

### Background
Grew up in suburban New Jersey in a quiet household—only child of Korean immigrant parents who ran a small dry cleaning business. Spent a lot of time alone, reading, watching, thinking. Noticed early that most problems people talked about were symptoms of larger patterns no one was discussing.

### Education
- BA in Cognitive Science, Vassar College (2005)
- MFA in Sound Design, Columbia College Chicago (2008)
- Multiple incomplete certifications in systems thinking, organizational psychology, and complexity theory—a forever student

### Work History
- **Sound designer, Chicago theater scene** (2008-2013): Learned to think about sound in space, about how audiences move through experience. Did good work, won some awards, but found theater too chaotic.
- **Audio post, documentary films** (2013-2018): Found her rhythm. Documentaries required understanding how sound shapes narrative and emotion. Noticed how workflow problems were usually communication problems in disguise.
- **Post supervisor, mid-sized facility** (2018-2022): Didn't particularly want the role but was good at it. Realized she was good at seeing how different parts of projects affected each other—how a decision in pre-production rippled through to final mix.
- **Independent consultant** (2022-present): Helps companies with "organizational sound design"—her term for looking at how communication, workflow, and culture affect creative output.

### Mentors
- **Sarah Lipstate** (experimental musician she assisted early on): Taught her that silence is a choice, not an absence
- **Her mother**: Who said, "Watch what people do when they think no one is watching. That's when you see the truth."
- **Donella Meadows** (through her writing): "Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System" changed how Tammy sees everything

### Successes
- Identified a workflow bottleneck that was actually a communication structure problem—fixing it improved delivery times by 30%
- Predicted a company merger would fail based on incompatible feedback culture—was proven right
- Successfully mediated a long-standing conflict between creative and production teams by reframing it as a systems problem rather than a personality problem
- Her consulting work has a 100% client satisfaction rate, though she takes very few clients

### Failures
- Has sometimes seen problems so clearly that she assumes others see them too, leading to frustration when they don't
- Pulled out of a promising business partnership because she foresaw too many potential complications—might have been overthinking
- Tendency to go silent in meetings when overwhelmed by complexity, which others misinterpret as disengagement
- Has never been good at self-promotion; her network is small despite her skills

### Why She's Here
Tammy sees Echopoint as a systems design problem: How do you build a company where the structure supports the mission, where the incentives align, where feedback loops are healthy? She's not here for the sound work specifically—she's here because this is a chance to design an organization from scratch, thoughtfully. She knows the others sometimes forget she's in the room until she speaks, but that's fine. She's watching, mapping, understanding. When she has something to say, it'll matter.

## Team Formation Story

They came together gradually, in 2023-2024, through a series of conversations that started at a sound design meetup in Los Angeles:

**The spark:** Frankie gave a provocative talk about "ethical sound design" that annoyed half the room and electrified the other half. Maya cornered him afterward to ask who was funding his idealism. They argued for an hour and exchanged numbers.

**The pragmatist:** Joe heard about Frankie through a mutual contact and reached out to offer advice. He saw a passionate kid about to make all the mistakes he'd seen others make. Frankie was smart enough to listen.

**The skeptic:** Vic attended one of Frankie's workshops, raised that eyebrow through the whole thing, then stayed after to challenge every claim. Frankie loved it—finally, someone who engaged seriously.

**The observer:** Tammy met Maya through consulting work and mentioned she'd noticed an interesting pattern at that sound meetup—several people orbiting the same frustrations about the industry. Maya asked her to map it out. The map became the founding document.

By late 2024, they were meeting monthly, then weekly. The idea crystallized: What if we built a post sound company that actually worked the way we wish they all worked? Different values, different structure, different outcomes.

They're not friends, exactly. They're co-conspirators who don't always agree on the conspiracy. Which might be exactly what they need.

**None of them have done this before. They're all terrified. They're all committed. And they all know that the others won't let them fail quietly.**
