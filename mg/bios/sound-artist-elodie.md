## Elodie “Lola” Vax — Fused Character Profile (Series Bible)

**Name (pronunciation):** Elodie (eh-loh-DEE / ay-loh-DEE), Vax (“vaks”)
**Age:** 34
**Origin:** Lyon, France → Berlin at 19 → now drifts between **London** and **The Soup Kitchen** (the only place she calls “home base”).

### 1) Vitals & Aesthetics (what she *looks* like in a room)

Elodie reads as **near-term cyberpunk** without trying: corporate glass reflected in failing infrastructure; clean LEDs over dirty power; pristine converters pointed at ugly reality.

**Visual signature:** utilitarian layers—boiler suit or minimal black with pockets like a field kit. Welding goggles (not cosplay; she *uses* them). One “too-nice” item from an older, better-paid life (boots, jacket, ring) that never quite matches the rest. Smells faintly of ozone, solder flux, and stale tobacco.  

**Mannerisms / tells:**

* Pauses mid-conversation to “listen behind” a sound—like she’s hearing a second track nobody else can.
* Writes tiny notes: timecodes, frequency bands, “room tone integrity,” “structural pulse.”
* Kindness shows up as competence: she fixes things quietly, then pretends she didn’t. 

**Gear signature (“the rig”):**

* A battered **Nagra Seven** sticker-bombed with dead noise-band logos.
* Contact mics, a small stereo pair, and *one wrong mic* she refuses to retire (cheap dictaphone, broken capsule, SDR/radio pickup).
* A necklace made from a severed XLR cable—half talisman, half warning label.

### 2) The Origin Story (“The Click”)

Elodie didn’t begin as an artist. She began as a **structural engineering mind** noticing what other people ignore.

**First click (the seduction):** during a controlled demolition in Marseille—cooling tower, big safety perimeter, everyone watching the spectacle—Elodie was listening to the *stress fractures* seconds before the fall. The “music” wasn’t the collapse; it was the warning that preceded it. That’s when she learned sound can be prophecy. 

**Second click (the wound that made her dangerous):** years later, while doing a late-night capture in a redeveloped building slated for a soft launch, she heard a low periodic “complaint” in the structure—alive in the concrete. She rolled anyway. A partial failure cascaded: injuries, lawsuits, a city moving on. Her recording contained the “before.” People with lawyers wanted it, then wanted her to forget it. She didn’t—she turned guilt into signal, and the signal turned into art. 

**What “The Click” means now:**
**Audio as proof. Audio as prophecy. Audio as trespass.**

### 3) Mentor (and the shadow she inherited)

**Klaus “The Butcher” Hever** — disgraced, legendary, uncredited. “Butcher” isn’t about bodies; it’s about what he does to **audio** and **truth**.

* Blacklisted from Hollywood for using real carcasses to record horror sounds (ethically radioactive; technically undeniable).
* Taught her: *“Digital audio is a lie; only the microphone tells the truth.”* / *“Every recording is a contract—know what you’re signing.”*
* Left her a small library of tapes, impulse responses, and “room signatures” from places she shouldn’t legally possess.

### 4) Professional Friction (why she keeps getting fired)

Elodie can operate at elite commercial standards—she just can’t stop telling the truth **in the margins**.

1. **Luxury car campaign (Bavarian Motors):** asked for "smooth, powerful, luxurious."
   She delivered gorgeous predation: engine purr + slowed panther growl + subsonic fault-line shift. Test audiences felt dread and nausea. Fired.  

2. **Meditation app (“CalmSpace”):** asked for “rain on window.”
   She hid whispers and a distant siren—so low you’d only *notice* with your nervous system. Users reported climate-nightmares. Fired.  

3. **Greeting Card Studios-style feature:** asked for "footsteps in snow."
   She laced cornstarch with the suggestion of breaking glass—romance walking on bones. Fired.  

4. **The enemy-maker gig (premium post house):** production audio contained something incriminating; she refused to sanitize it into a lie. She wasn’t trying to blow anything up—she was trying not to falsify the archive. That distinction did not protect her.

### 5) Survival Economy (how she pays rent *this month*)

Elodie lives in the **Grey Audio Market**, where ethics and invoices rarely match.

* **Forensic cleanup** for lawyers, journalists, unions, and people who can’t go to police.
* **Black-box repair + data recovery:** recorders, old media, corrupted sessions—“stories trapped inside machines.”
* **Ghost-noise / haunt beds** for games/film/trailers under aliases.
* **Session salvage:** walks into a broken mix; leaves it standing.
* **Vintage synth repair:** one of the few who’ll touch Soviet-era Polivoks; paid in cash or rare vacuum tubes.

### 6) The Work (installations that made her a problem)

1. **The Apiary Collapse (2022):** “system dying politely.”
   Swarm textures + failing mechanical rhythms; sub pressure that turns empathy into nausea. Seismology lab complained from miles away.  

2. **Echoes of the Eviction (2024):** spaces as witnesses.
   Contact mics on walls of a building being emptied; convolution portraits of absence played back into the new luxury units built on top. Critic praise; public horror; developers quietly furious.  

3. **Neon Psalter (in progress, 2025):** her living “map.”
   Sonifies **power, data, and human voice** as one organism. It can be experienced as art—or as a diagram of who is being pressured, watched, displaced. It also puts **The Soup Kitchen** on the wrong radar.

### 7) Psychological Profile (what drives her, what breaks her)

**Surface:** abrasive, intense, morally allergic to corporate euphemism. She uses words like “violence” for systems, not people. 

**Core:** chaotic-good—she cares, but expresses care as **precision** and refusal to bullshit. She protects interns, runners, and overworked assistants on instinct. 

**Belief:** the modern world is “over-compressed.” **Dynamic range is a moral issue.** Compression—audio and societal—hides pain, hides proof, hides responsibility. She distorts to force attention. 

**Fear:** not quiet—**erasure.** The sense that something happened and nobody will be able to prove it. “Silence is where they hide the body.” 

**Compulsion:** keep the raw take, keep the room tone, keep the “before.” She will not destroy source unless she’s protecting a vulnerable person. 

---

### 8) Toolkit Philosophy (how she works, what she refuses)

**Rule:** *Clean is not the same as true.* 

**Signature techniques:**

* **Resonance mapping:** finds the hidden beat of buildings and machines (subharmonics, cyclical failures).
* **Convolution as autobiography:** real spaces as impulse responses—location clings to sound like scent.
* **Voice as system artifact:** makes dialogue feel embedded in a device without cliché “telephone EQ”—subtle spectral fingerprinting, not gimmicks. 

**Loves:**

* **Granular** (breaks time into atoms).
* **Distortion** (reveals hidden harmonics; makes truth audible).
* **Contact mics** (listen to the inside of the world). 

**Hates:**

* **Quantization:** “Life doesn’t happen on the grid.”
* **Auto-tune:** “If you can’t hit the note, scream it.”
* **Presets:** “A preset is someone else’s memory.” 

---

### 9) Voice (quick lines you can drop into scenes)

* “Don’t clean it until we’ve understood it.” 
* “Give me the raw take. I’ll decide what’s noise after I meet it.” 
* “I don’t hate you. I hate the system that taught you to call this normal.” 
* “Yes, I can make it shiny. No, you won’t like what it costs.” 
* “Life is not a limiter. Stop mastering the world.” (new, but fits her ethos)

### 10) Current Throughline (what she wants *right now*)

1. Finish **Neon Psalter** without getting The Soup Kitchen shut down. 
2. Keep (or bury) the one recording that proves what happened during her “second click”—because somebody powerful is still hunting for the clean version of history. 
3. Stay solvent without selling her ethics—an increasingly narrow corridor she navigates by ear.
