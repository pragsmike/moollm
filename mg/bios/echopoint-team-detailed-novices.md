# The Echopoint Team: The "Greenhorns"

*Context: This team has raw talent and enthusiasm, but they are functionally amateurs in the world of high-stakes audio post. They are relying heavily on their instincts, each other, and the guidance of Marcus’s consultancy to survive.*

## Frankie "Kerouac" Rodriguez — The Bedroom Dreamer

**Age:** 23 | **Role:** Creative Lead (Nominal)
**Experience Level:** Novice / Enthusiast

### Background & Skills
Frankie is a creator in the purest sense—meaning he has zero constraints because he’s never had a boss. He hosts a niche philosophy podcast that he records in his closet under a duvet. It sounds surprisingly good because he spent three months obsessing over mic placement.

-   **Audio Experience:** Has edited 50 episodes of his own podcast using free software (Audacity/Reaper). He has a great ear for dialogue editing but has never worked with video sync, timecode, or surround sound.
-   **Industry Exposure:** Interned for two weeks at a radio station before getting bored. Spent a lot of time watching Sal work, asking "why" but never touching the controls.
-   **Predilection:** Big ideas. He talks about "sonic landscapes" and "emotional resonance." He needs to learn that sometimes a job is just removing air conditioner noise, not art.

## Maya "Tilted Hat" Chen — The Gig Worker

**Age:** 26 | **Role:** Operations & Booking
**Experience Level:** Junior Admin

### Background & Skills
Maya has hustled since college. She’s worked as a receptionist at a yoga studio, a dog walker for rich celebrities, and a temp admin for a law firm during tax season. She is organized because she has to be to juggle three part-time jobs.

-   **Business Experience:** Good at Google Calendar, email etiquette, and appearing professional when terrified. She helped Sal organize his receipts one weekend, which is her only experience with "studio management."
-   **Industry Exposure:** None. She thinks a "compressor" is something you use to inflate tires.
-   **Predilection:** Defense. She is terrifyingly protective of the team and the money, mostly because she knows how little they have. She treats the business like a household budget—every penny counts.

## Joe "Gusher" Castellano — The AV Guy

**Age:** 38 | **Role:** Facilities & Technical Support
**Experience Level:** Utility Tech

### Background & Skills
Joe is the guy you call to mount a TV or fix a broken HDMI port. He works for a commercial AV installation company, pulling Cat6 cable through ceilings in office buildings. He’s a hard worker with steady hands, but his "audio" experience is limited to PA systems in conference rooms.

-   **Audio Experience:** Can solder a patch cable in the dark. Knows signal flow (Input -> Output). Has mixed sound for his nephew’s garage band on a 4-channel mixer.
-   **Industry Exposure:** He fixed the AC unit in Sal’s studio once, and Sal let him hang around to watch a mix session. Joe was too scared to ask questions.
-   **Predilection:** Hardware. He loves the gear but is intimidated by the creative process. He’s comfortable fixing the chair, not the mix.

## Victor "Vic 'Eyebrow'" Okonkwo — The Forum Dweller

**Age:** 29 | **Role:** Systems & IT
**Experience Level:** Hobbyist / Student

### Background & Skills
Vic is an IT helpdesk technician by day. By night, he is a prolific poster on audio engineering forums. He has read every manual for every piece of software in the studio but has never used them on a paying client. He mods video game audio files for fun.

-   **Audio Experience:** He has a "pirate" knowledge base—he knows the software architecture, the cracks, and the workarounds, but has no concept of professional workflow or delivery standards (StreamBox spec, broadcast loudness).
-   **Industry Exposure:** Vic knows **Marcus** (the consultant) from a vintage synth repair group online. That’s his only link to the pro world.
-   **Predilection:** Theory over practice. He will argue for three hours about sample rates but freeze up if a client asks for a "warmer" sound.

## Tammy "Silent" Park — The Shift Supervisor

**Age:** 32 | **Role:** Scheduling & Workflow
**Experience Level:** Retail Management

### Background & Skills
Tammy managed a high-volume coffee shop for four years. She knows how to handle a rush, how to de-escalate an angry customer, and how to make a schedule that doesn't violate labor laws. She met the group because she runs the community board game night they all attend.

-   **Business Experience:** Excellent at inventory and people management. If you can coordinate six baristas during the morning rush, you can coordinate a studio—in theory.
-   **Industry Exposure:** Absolutely zero. She is learning the terminology from flashcards Maya made her.
-   **Predilection:** Flow. She doesn't care about the art; she cares that the project moves from A to B without setting the building on fire. She is the only one checking the clock.

### The Setup for the Consultancy
The team is painfully aware that **EchoPoint** is currently a Ferrari being driven by toddlers. They have the keys (thanks to Sal), but they don't know how to drive.

They have officially retained **Marcus's Group** (The Consultants) to teach them how to be professionals before the March rent deadline hits.

*   **Frankie** is looking to Marcus’s team to teach him how to actually mix.
*   **Vic** is hoping to impress Marcus with his technical knowledge (and will likely be humbled).
*   **Maya** and **Tammy** are hoping Marcus can give them a template for contracts and billing so they don't go to jail.
*   **Joe** is just hoping he doesn't break anything expensive.
