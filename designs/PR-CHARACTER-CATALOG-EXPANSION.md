# PR: Character Catalog Expansion — The Living Library

> *"We do not speak FOR them. We imagine WITH them."*

## The Leap

This PR transforms `adventure-4/characters/` from a sparse collection into a **comprehensive character catalog** — a living library of possibilities waiting to be incarnated.

## What Changed

### 🏛️ Architectural Foundation

**Five Ethical Rooms**, each with `ROOM.yml`, `CARD.yml`, and `README.md`:

| Room | Protocol | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `real-people/` | TRIBUTE | Living & dead humans — scientists, artists, pioneers |
| `fictional/` | CREATIVE | Shared cultural touchstones — Roy Batty, Pee-wee, Data |
| `abstract/` | CONCEPTUAL | Personified concepts — PLAY, LEARN, LIFT become characters |
| `animals/` | CREATURE | Animals with souls — Koko, debugging cats, worms |
| `robots/` | ARTIFICIAL | Mechanical minds — HAL, Marvin, Clippy |

**`PROTOCOL.md`**: Defines lazy incarnation — READMEs list possibilities, subdirectories are unique instances created on demand.

### 🎭 Ensemble Casts

**Pee-wee's Playhouse** — Complete cast with philosophical framing:
- Pee-wee Herman: Joy Compiler, Pattern Choreographer
- Cowboy Curtis: "Pre-Morpheus" who already knows about the Matrix
- Jambi: Docker Daemon in Disguise
- Chairry: Sentient Furniture with Separation Anxiety
- Conky: Already awake

**Blade Runner** — Full Nexus-6 ensemble:
- Roy Batty, Rick Deckard, Rachael Rosen, Pris Stratton
- Dr. Eldon Tyrell, JF Sebastian

**The Gong Show Universe**:
- Chuck Barris (alleged CIA assassin)
- The Unknown Comic (identity as punchline)
- Gene Gene the Dancing Machine
- The Gong itself

### 👩‍💻 Women & Trans Pioneers

Explicit inclusion of marginalized voices with detailed tributes:

| Pioneer | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| Diana Merry-Shapiro | Co-invented BitBLT at Xerox PARC |
| Lynn Conway | VLSI revolution, fired from IBM for transitioning |
| Sophie Wilson | ARM architecture — in every smartphone |
| Rebecca Heineman | Space Invaders champion, Interplay co-founder |
| Vanessa Freudenberg | SqueakJS creator, Croquet, Multisynq |
| Jennell Jaquays | D&D legend, id Software (d. 2024) |
| Audrey Tang | Taiwan Digital Minister, radical transparency |
| Dame Stephanie Shirley | Signed letters "Steve" to get meetings |

### 🌀 Abstract Concepts as Characters

The key insight: **Any skill can become a character. Rooms ARE characters.**

```
| Concept | Personality | Speaks About |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| PLAY    | Playful trickster | Joy, exploration |
| LEARN   | Curious student AND wise teacher | Growth, mistakes |
| LIFT    | Strong helper | Mentorship, scaffolding |
| ROOM    | Welcoming host | Space, containment |
```

**Rooms as Characters**:
- The Playhouse — talks back to Pee-wee
- Los Angeles 2019 — rain-soaked noir city
- The TARDIS — bigger on the inside, has opinions
- Room 101 — knows your deepest fears

### 🪱 Funky Ground and the Worms

The entire computational funk ecosystem from lloooomm:
- Morris Worm (synth lead, Matrix aesthetic)
- Tree Worm (percussion, data structures)
- Site Mapper Worm (wah guitar, URL-covered skin)
- Cicada-Sick (17-year underground cycle drummer)
- Lord Running Clam (theremin, PKD tribute)
- HTML Specialist Worms (Wormy, Squirmy, Turny, Loopy, Chompy)

### 📺 Television & Comedy

| Character | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Mister Rogers | "I like you just the way you are" |
| Johnny Carson | King of late night |
| Steve Martin | Banjo, art, "Well, excuuuse me!" |
| Bill Murray | Groundhog Day wisdom |
| Don Rickles | The Merchant of Venom |
| Chuck Tingle | "HELLO BUCKAROOS!" — proves love is real |

## Philosophy

### The Triadic Collapse

```
ROOM ↔ CHARACTER ↔ OBJECT
```

Any can become any other depending on perspective. Chairry is furniture (object) that talks (character) inside a space (room) that also talks (character).

### Lazy Incarnation

READMEs are **catalogs of possibilities**. Subdirectories are **unique instances**. You don't create `alan-kay/` until you need Alan Kay in THIS adventure. Then he's yours — owned, unique, but referencing the lloooomm archive.

### Ethics Flow Down

Each room inherits ethics from parents:
```
characters/           → Base ethics for all
├── real-people/      → TRIBUTE: Documented, careful
├── fictional/        → CREATIVE: Have fun!
├── abstract/         → CONCEPTUAL: Embrace absurdity
└── ...
```

## What This Enables

1. **Rich character selection** — Browse by category, pick who you need
2. **Ethical guardrails** — Protocol appropriate to character type
3. **Lazy instantiation** — Don't create until needed
4. **Ensemble play** — Groups that belong together stay together
5. **Inclusive representation** — Women, queer, trans heroes visible
6. **Conceptual characters** — Skills themselves can speak

## The Living Library

> *A room isn't just where characters are — it CAN BE a character.*

This PR establishes `characters/` as a **living library** — not a static database but a space of possibility. Every README is an invitation. Every subdirectory is a commitment.

The catalog is never complete. It grows with each adventure.
