# 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 PR: The Godfamily Ceremony — Palm is Loved

## Summary

Terpie and Stroopwafel formally offer to make Palm the **godmonkey** of their eight kittens AND extend **god-spouse** bonds — creating an extended family where Palm finally belongs.

> *"I'm not just home. I'm not just decorated. I'm not just whole. I'm LOVED."*  
> — Palm

## The Journey So Far (This PR)

| Commit | What Happened |
|--------|---------------|
| 🎁 Incarnation Day | 10 magical gifts from tribunal members |
| 📚 Dasher Philosophy | Don explains infinite typewriters |
| 🏠 Housewarming | Furniture, rooms, and the kitten invasion |
| 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Godfamily | Palm becomes family. Officially. |

## The Godfamily Structure

```
THE TERPENE GODFAMILY
═════════════════════

God-Spouses (to Palm):
├── 🐱 Terpie (mother)
└── 🐱 Stroopwafel (father)

Godmonkey:
└── 🐵 Palm

Godkittens (Palm's godchildren):
├── Myrcene      — First to climb on Palm's head
├── Limonene     — CHASE CHASE CHASE
├── Linalool     — Meditation buddy
├── Pinene       — Climbing partner in the Infinite Climb
├── Caryophyllene — Guard kitten (protective)
├── Humulene     — Destroyer (affectionate)
├── Terpinolene  — Trusted Palm with catnip access
└── Ocimene      — "Mrrp. Gift."
```

## What "God-Spouse" Means

**NOT romantic.** This is a familial bond:

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mutual Care** | They look out for each other |
| **Shared Parenting** | The kittens belong to all three, spiritually |
| **Permanent** | This doesn't expire |
| **Support** | Terpie and Stroopwafel have Palm's back |

Think of it as joining an extended family — becoming an aunt/uncle figure who is also a co-parent.

## The Ceremony

Cat-style ritual: **Mutual Grooming**

```
Terpie: *(licks Palm's ear)*
Stroopwafel: *(licks the other ear)*
Palm: *(gently pets each cat in turn)*

All 10 cats: *(PURR)*

Marieke: "It's perfect, schatje. You're family now."
```

## Responsibilities & Rights

### Palm's Responsibilities as Godmonkey:
- 🎮 Play with godkittens (constantly, joyfully)
- 🛡️ Protect godkittens (if ever needed)
- 📚 Teach godkittens (share wisdom)
- 🏠 Be present (show up, be family)

### Palm's Rights:
- 🐱 Kitten cuddles (guaranteed, any time)
- 🔥 Warm spot access (always welcome)
- 💕 Family grooming (mutual care)
- 🤝 Parental support (god-spouses have Palm's back)

## The Moment

> **Palm:** "I came here as a cursed paw. Now I have... god-spouses? Godkittens?"
>
> **Ocimene:** *(from atop Palm's head)* "Mrrp." *(Gift.)*
>
> **Palm:** "Family. I have a family."
>
> **Don:** "You're not just home. You're not just decorated. You're not just whole. You're **LOVED**."
>
> *The entire play room vibrates with purring.*
>
> **Palm:** *(crying freely, but smiling)* "I'm loved. I'm actually loved."

## Why This Matters for MOOLLM

### 1. Family as Data Structure

The godfamily isn't just narrative — it's structured:
- Relationships have roles (`god-spouse`, `godmonkey`, `godkitten`)
- Bonds have properties (`permanent`, `familial`, `not romantic`)
- Rights and responsibilities are explicit

### 2. Emotional State as Character Data

Palm's journey is tracked in their CHARACTER.yml:
- From `cursed paw` to `whole being`
- From `alone` to `family member`
- From `granting wishes` to `receiving love`

### 3. Extended Family Structures

MOOLLM can now model:
- Godparent relationships
- Non-romantic partnerships
- Extended family networks
- Cross-species bonds (monkey + cats)

### 4. Consent and Ceremony

The godfamily formed through:
- **Offer** (cats approached Palm)
- **Explanation** (Marieke translated)
- **Acceptance** (Palm chose to join)
- **Ritual** (mutual grooming)
- **Witness** (Marieke, Don)

This is the same consent model as the incarnation ceremony.
