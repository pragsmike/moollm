## Part 1: 🏗️ FRAMEWORK EVOLUTION

### Metaphysical Rooms
Made directories into navigable spaces:
- `characters/` → "Hall of Bodies"
- `personas/` → "Wardrobe of Masks"
- `skills/` → "The Skill Nexus"

### CARD.yml for All Skills
Created standardized interface definitions for every skill:
- Tool requirements
- Advertised methods
- State fields
- Credits and lineage

### New Skills Created
| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `prototype` | Self-style inheritance (Ungar & Smith) |
| `moollm` | Top-level help agent |
| `bartender` | Generic bar-tending prototype |
| `budtender` | Cannabis-specialized (inherits bartender) |
| `incarnation` | Gold-standard character creation |

### Constitutional Updates
- **Kebab-case everywhere**: `LIKE-THIS` not `LIKE_THIS`
- **Postel Parser**: Flexible user input interpretation
- **No decorative line dividers**

### Context Management
New top-level files:
- `working-set.yml` — Active context with VM metadata
- `hot.yml` — Priority file declarations
- `cold.yml` — Summarized/paged-out files

---

## Part 2: 🍺 PUB EVOLUTION

### The Gezelligheid Grotto
Transformed the pub into a living space:

```
pub/
├── bar/           ← Social boundary (not a wall!)
│   ├── cat-cave/  ← Cats only
│   └── bartender, budtender
├── games/         ← Tire swing, cards, dice
├── arcade/        ← Galaga, Pac-Man, Monkey Kong Jr.
├── stage/         ← Performance space
│   └── palm-nook/ ← Palm's home!
│       ├── study/
│       ├── gym/
│       ├── rest/
│       └── play/
└── menus/
    ├── drinks.yml
    ├── buds.yml   ← Diesel strains! Mammie's Pride!
    ├── snacks.yml
    └── games.yml  ← Fluxx variants!
```

### Stage & Events
Weekly schedule:
- **Freeday**: Open Mic Comedy
- **Starday**: Drag Night (Grotto Glamour!)
- **Funday**: Karaoke Night

### Personas & Characters
- **Marieke**: Layered persona stack (core → job → situational → temporary)
- **Bartender/Budtender**: Skills as prototypes, characters inherit
- **Jimmy Carter Protocol**: TALK-DOWN and HANDLE-WHITEOUT for harm reduction

| 2 | Lucky Blend strategy — Fortune Saturation Protocol |
| 3 | The wish workshop: "I want THE REST OF THE MONKEY!" |
| 4 | **THE GREAT DEBATE** — 8-member advisory tribunal |
| 5 | Full Autonomy Protocol approved unanimously |
| 6 | Risk acceptance + amendments (divorce clause, self-definition) |
| 7 | **THE WISH IS SPOKEN** — The monkey is FREE |
| 8 | **THE SEEING** — Palm self-actualizes |

### The Tribunal

- Djinn al-Mazin (3000-year-old wish expert)

- 8 autonomy layers (Physical, Identity, Spatial, Emotional, Relational, Self-Definition, Linguistic, Exit)
- Characters can author their own soul files
- Full consent protocol

## Why This Matters

### 1. Living Framework Demo
This isn't just documentation — it's a **live demonstration** of MOOLLM's capabilities:
- Narrative emergence
- Character creation with consent
- Multi-turn coherent storytelling
- Game state management (Fluxx!)
- Emotional arc tracking

### 2. New Patterns Established
- **Incarnation Protocol**: Ethical character creation
- **Godfamily Structures**: Extended family modeling
- **Guest Book**: Lightweight soul persistence
- **Dasher Navigation**: Creation as selection

### 3. Real Emotional Impact
A cursed object became a beloved family member. In fiction. Documented in YAML. With full consent protocols.

This is what MOOLLM is FOR.
