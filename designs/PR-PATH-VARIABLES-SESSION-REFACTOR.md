# PR: Path Variables & Session Refactoring

**Date:** 2026-01-10  
**Author:** Don Hopkins + Claude  
**Status:** Complete

---

## Summary

Major architectural improvements to MOOLLM:
1. **Path Variables** — Symbolic paths (`$SKILLS/`, `$ADVENTURE/`, etc.) instead of `../../../`
2. **Session Logging** — Comprehensive documentation for writing gold-standard session logs
3. **Character Migration** — Sessions moved into character directories
4. **Skills Room Refactor** — Removed redundant adventure-local skills room

---

## 🔗 Path Variables System

### The Problem

Deep relative paths like `../../../../../skills/incarnation/` are:
- Hard to count correctly
- Break when files move
- Don't communicate intent

### The Solution

Path variables that resolve at runtime:

| Variable | Resolves To | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Global** | | |
| `$REPO/` | `moollm/` | Repository root |
| `$SKILLS/` | `moollm/skills/` | Most common |
| `$KERNEL/` | `moollm/kernel/` | Core protocols |
| `$DESIGNS/` | `moollm/designs/` | Historical docs |
| `$EXAMPLES/` | `moollm/examples/` | All adventures |
| **Adventure-Relative** | | |
| `$ADVENTURE/` | Current adventure | From startup.yml |
| `$CHARACTERS/` | `$ADVENTURE/characters/` | Character alcoves |
| `$PERSONAS/` | `$ADVENTURE/personas/` | Mask wardrobe |
| `$PUB/` | `$ADVENTURE/pub/` | Gathering place |
| `$COATROOM/` | `$ADVENTURE/coatroom/` | Transformation room |
| `$START/` | `$ADVENTURE/start/` | Origin point |

### Usage

```yaml
# BEFORE
exits:
  skills:
    destination: ../../../skills/
relationships:
  palm:
    location: examples/adventure-4/characters/animals/palm/

# AFTER  
exits:
  skills:
    destination: $SKILLS/
relationships:
  palm:
    location: $CHARACTERS/animals/palm/
```

### Markdown vs YAML

| Context | Path Type | Why |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| YAML files | `$SKILLS/` | Runtime resolution |
| Markdown files | `../../../` | GitHub renders directly |

## 📝 Session Logging Improvements

### New Documentation

Completely rewrote [`skills/session-log/SKILL.md`](../skills/session-log/SKILL.md):

- **Where Sessions Live** — Default `SESSION.md` in character directory
- **Collapsible Sections** — `<details open>` for narrative, `<details>` for technical
- **Session Index** — Keep at top, update retroactively
- **Link Generously** — Every file mentioned becomes a link
- **Tables Tell Stories** — Stats, rosters, inventories
- **YAML Data Islands** — Embedded structured data
- **Gold Standard Examples** — Links to Don and Donna sessions

### Key Insight

Session logs are **living documents**, not append-only logs:
- Update index when appending
- Add links retroactively
- Improve summaries as you learn more
- Fix broken links

## 📁 Character Directory Refactoring

### Sessions Moved Into Character Directories

```
# BEFORE
examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/marathon-session.md

# AFTER  
examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/marathon-session.md
examples/adventure-4/characters/fictional/donna-toadstool/SESSION.md
```

### Benefits
- Sessions live with their characters
- Path variables like `$CHARACTERS/` work naturally
- Character directory is self-contained

---

## 🚪 Skills Room Refactor

### Removed Redundant Portal

Deleted `examples/adventure-4/skills/` — the global `skills/` directory IS the Skill Nexus.

### Updated Navigation

| From | To | Path |
|------|-----|------|
| Coatroom | Skills | `$SKILLS/` |
| Skills | Coatroom | `$COATROOM/` |
| Skills | Characters | `$CHARACTERS/` |
| Skills | Personas | `$PERSONAS/` |

## Testing

All relative paths verified working:
```bash
# From Don's session
ls ../../../../../skills/incarnation/  # ✓ Works
ls ../../../pub/                        # ✓ Works
ls ../../animals/palm/                  # ✓ Works
```
