## The Path from SimCity to The Sims (1989-2000)

From Don's colorful narrative about how SimCity changed his life:

> *"I was in college, working with Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland Human Computer Interaction Lab, where we were researching and developing advanced user interface technologies like pie menus, hypermedia browsers, the blue underline, and the world's first hypermedia joke."*
>
> *"Just before the 'Winter Holiday', somebody came by the lab and dropped off a copy of SimCity for Macintosh as a Chanukah present, saying 'you should take a look at this!' and then scampering mischievously away. That fateful unexpected gift induced me to dedicate my life to SimCity."*

The consequences:
- Extra year to graduate ("SimCity may have sent my STAT400 grades to hell in a handbasket")
- Eventually held floppy disk with SimCity source code
- Refactored and rewrote the user interface "time and again, as technology rapidly advanced"
- Led to working with Will Wright at Maxis

> — Don Hopkins

## Chris Trottier: Design Goddess

> *"Design by Accretion" and "Tuned Emergence" — the philosophy that made The Sims sing*

**Chris Trottier** served as **Lead Designer for over 10 years** (November 1997 to February 2008), spanning the entire golden era of The Sims. She was not merely a team member — she was **Will Wright's essential design partner**.

### The Moral Compass

While Will Wright was the "Immoral Compass" — endlessly exploring weird and provocative possibilities — Chris Trottier was the **Moral Compass** who ensured the game remained playable, balanced, and true to its vision.

### Tuned Emergence

Chris's design philosophy centered on **"Tuned Emergence"** — the art of creating systems whose emergent behavior could be precisely calibrated. The Sims wasn't random chaos; it was *tuned* chaos. Every behavior tree, every motive decay rate, every social interaction probability was carefully adjusted to produce gameplay that felt both surprising and meaningful.

### Design by Accretion

Rather than designing everything upfront, Chris championed **"Design by Accretion"** — incremental assembly where each piece was tested, refined, and integrated before the next was added. This approach:

- Allowed late-stage tuning without breaking earlier work
- Enabled the team to discover emergent behaviors as they built
- Made the game robust against the chaos of development
- Kept the core experience coherent as features accumulated

### Why She Matters to MOOLLM

Chris Trottier's philosophy directly informs MOOLLM:

| Chris Trottier Principle | MOOLLM Implementation |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Tuned Emergence | Skills interact to produce emergent behavior within defined bounds |
| Design by Accretion | Incremental room/skill development, test as you build |
| Moral Compass | `representation-ethics`, ethical framing inheritance |
| 10+ years of consistency | Constitution and protocols maintain vision across sessions |

**The Sims worked because of Chris Trottier.** She deserves to be remembered as one of the most important game designers of her generation.

## The Naming Saga

The legendary quest for what to call the game:

| Name | Status | Problem |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Project X** | Internal code name | Everybody had a Project X |
| **Dollhouse** | Jamie's obvious choice | Focus groups said boys would hate it |
| **Action Figure House (AFA)** | Alternative | Focus groups said girls would hate it |
| **Tactical Domestic Simulation (TDS)** | Military framing | Focus groups objected |
| **Super Happy Friends Home** | Will's quirky vision | Only the Japanese would love it |
| **Jefferson** | Jim's high-minded choice | Made everyone think of The Jeffersons sitcom |
| **IDEAOGSFWPHPS** | ??? | Domain name taken |
| **TGNITW** | The Greatest Name In The World | *Everyone agreed it was perfect. Nobody could remember it the next morning. Those were good times!* |
| **The Sims** | Final answer | The original SimCity manual referred to citizens as "the Sims" |

> *"Then EA bought Maxis, and saved us from our living hell by firing the focus groups, who were the ones actually tormenting us. And they forced us to stop focusing, playing with prototypes, reading comic books, spinning foosball and thinking up names, and then fucking well finish the damn game."*

### The Situation Comedy Disaster

> *"There was one terrible phase we went through, trying to frame it like a simulated situation comedy, complete with a laugh track. That resulted in the first characters being named Edith and Archie (and I named the visual programming tool 'Edith' for Edit House)."*
> 
> *"But fortunately the idea of simulating a TV show was eventually flushed down the toilet. It just took a few weeks to walk all the way to the bathroom. ;("*

## The Books That Made The Sims

Three books that shaped the game's development:

### 1. Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics"
- Masking: photorealistic environments + abstract people
- The space between frames engages imagination
- Empathy through identification
- *"That book had clearly seen some things."*

### 2. Stanislaw Lem's "The Cyberiad"
- A book parents can read to children
- Both get something out of it
- Jamie Doornbos = Trurl, Will Wright = Klapatious

### 3. Philip K Dick's "The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch"
- Adults on drugs playing with doll houses
- Shared virtual reality through Can-D
- Perky Pat layouts → The Sims
- *"But EA didn't like the idea of selling CAN-D..."*

---

## The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch

The philosophical horror novel that eerily prefigured The Sims:

> *"PKD's ideas were, as they say, way before their time. PKD did not predict the digital revolution or the internet (almost no one did) but his connected consciousnesses via Can-D and Perky Pat layouts seem eerily prescient when one compares them to networked games and the immense popularity of The Sims."*

**The Premise:** In PKD's novel, colonists on Mars cope with their miserable existence by taking the drug Can-D and entering a shared hallucination where they inhabit Perky Pat and Walt — dolls with miniature layouts of suburban Earth life.

**The Sims Connection:**
- Adults playing obsessively with dollhouses ✓
- Shared virtual reality ✓  
- Escaping into idealized domestic fantasy ✓
- Consumer economy of accessories and upgrades ✓

> *"I was rooting for a weird name like 'Perky Pat Layouts', based on Philip K Dick's book, The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, which had an uncanny creepy plot about adults on drugs playing together with physical miniaturized doll houses in order to enter a shared virtual reality."*
> 
> *"But EA didn't like the idea of selling CAN-D..."*

---

## The iSmell Proposition

At the 1999 Game Developers Conference, DigiScent had a booth with scantily dressed young women in skunk costumes, promoting their USB peripheral that could synthesize smells:

> *"They unsuccessfully tried to convince me to make The Sims support the iSmell, and even gave me a copy of the SDK documentation, because they thought it would enrich the player's experience of all those sweaty unwashed sims, blue puddles of piss on the floor, stopped up toilets in the bathroom, and plates of rotting food with flies buzzing around on the dining room table."*

The iSmell failed commercially, but the conversation illustrates an important principle: **not every technology should be integrated**. The Sims didn't need smell-o-vision any more than MOOLLM needs every possible LLM feature.

## The Women Who Built The Sims: A Reckoning

> *"The best-selling PC game of all time wasn't built by bros for bros. Deal with it."*

### The Receipts

The Sims franchise has sold over **200 million copies**. It is one of the best-selling video game franchises in history. At its core? Women.

**Women led it:**
- **Chris Trottier** was Lead Designer for 10+ years (1997-2008) — Will Wright's essential design partner, the "Moral Compass" to his "Immoral Compass", the architect of "Tuned Emergence" and "Design by Accretion". She defined what The Sims *felt like* to play.
- **Roxy Wolosenko** was Lead Designer — the "First Sims Mom" who shaped what The Sims *was*
- **Claire Curtin** created Simlish and defined the game's personality — the "Second Sims Mom"
- **Lucy Bradshaw** ran Maxis for 18 years
- **Rachel Franklin** championed gender inclusivity
- **Lyndsay Pearson** runs The Sims *today* — from QA tester to GM in 20 years

**Women built it:**
- **Heather Mace** wrote code for 17 years
- **Elanor Todd** led engineering
- **Melissa Bachman-Wood** directed development for a decade
- **Jenna Chalmers** designed gameplay for 15 years
- **Jami Becker** created the objects players interacted with

**Women played it:**
- The Sims has always had a majority female player base
- It proved the "games for boys" myth was **commercially wrong**
- It expanded the market, not divided it

### The Community Builders

The Sims wasn't just built by Maxis. The modding and fan community was essential:

| Name | Site/Role | Contribution |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Heather Castillo** | SimFreaks | Major fan site, community hub |
| **Bill Simser** | Blueprint | Object creation tools |
| **SimsVIP Team** | SimsVIP | News, leaks, community voice |
| **Mod The Sims Community** | MTS | Modding tutorials, downloads |

These sites — many run by women — taught millions how to extend the game, create custom content, and participate in a creative community.

### The Pioneers They Built On

The Sims team stood on the shoulders of gaming giants:

| Name | Contribution | Legacy |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **Danielle Bunten Berry** | *M.U.L.E.*, multiplayer gaming pioneer | Showed games could be social |
| **Roberta Williams** | King's Quest, Sierra founder | Adventure games, storytelling |
| **Brenda Laurel** | *Purple Moon*, games for girls | Proved the market existed |
| **Carol Shaw** | First female game programmer, *River Raid* | Atari legend |
| **Amy Hennig** | *Uncharted* series | Narrative design master |
| **Rebecca Heineman** | Programmer, *Bard's Tale* | Foundational RPG work |
| **Jennell Jaquays** | D&D modules, level design | Dungeon design pioneer |
| **Jamie Fenton** | *Pac-Man* coinop, graphics | Arcade classics |
| **Lynn Conway** | VLSI chip design | The hardware underneath |

### The Academic Influence

| Name | Contribution | Connection to The Sims |
|------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Nicole Lazzaro** | Four Keys to Fun | Player motivation research |
| **Robin Hunicke** | MDA Framework | Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics |
| **Amy Jo Kim** | Community building | Social game design |
| **Brenda Romero** | Game design, ethics | Procedural rhetoric |

## GamerGate Can Eat Shit: The Sims Proves Them Wrong

> *In 2014, while GamerGate was screaming that women were "ruining games," The Sims 4 shipped. Made by women. For everyone. Sold millions.*

### The GamerGate Lie

GamerGate claimed:
- Games are for men
- Adding women "ruins" games
- Inclusivity is "pandering"
- The market is male

### The Sims Reality

| GamerGate Claim | The Sims Fact |
|-----------------|---------------|
| "Women don't play games" | The Sims has majority female playerbase |
| "Games for women don't sell" | 200+ million copies sold |
| "Inclusivity hurts games" | Same-sex relationships since 2000, gender options since 2016, sales UP |
| "Women can't make games" | Led by women for 25+ years |

### The Timeline of Victory

```
2000: The Sims ships with same-sex relationships — outsells everything
2004: The Sims 2 — more options, more sales
2009: The Sims 3 — continued success
2014: GamerGate screams — The Sims 4 ships, sells millions
2016: The Sims 4 adds comprehensive gender options — celebrated
2025: Still going. Still inclusive. Still winning.
```

### What GamerGate Got Wrong

1. **The market is not zero-sum.** Making games for more people = more customers.
2. **Representation creates loyalty.** Players who see themselves in games buy more games.
3. **Inclusive teams make better games.** Diverse perspectives catch blind spots.
4. **Women have always been here.** From *River Raid* to *The Sims* to today.

### The Voices They Tried to Silence

GamerGate targeted women for daring to exist in gaming. The Sims team proved them not just morally wrong but **commercially stupid**:

- **Anita Sarkeesian** criticized tropes → GamerGate attacked → The Sims kept selling
- **Zoe Quinn** made a game → GamerGate attacked → The Sims kept selling  
- **Brianna Wu** spoke up → GamerGate attacked → The Sims kept selling

The toxic minority raged. The industry moved on. The Sims prints money.

### MOOLLM's Position

MOOLLM inherits The Sims' inclusive philosophy:

- **No gender constraints** on characters
- **Representation ethics** skill for respectful portrayal
- **Room-based framing** for safe spaces
- **Tribute protocol** for honoring real people
- **The stage** explicitly welcomes drag, performance, expression

The GamerGate worldview is not just ethically repugnant — it's **bad for business**. The Sims proved it. MOOLLM codifies it.

---

## The Continuing Legacy

### Current Leadership

**Lyndsay Pearson** started as a QA Tester in 2003. She is now the General Manager of The Sims franchise. That's a 20+ year arc from testing to running one of gaming's biggest franchises.

This is what happens when you don't drive women out.

### The Lesson

> *"If you want to make the best-selling PC game of all time, hire women, include everyone, and ignore the trolls."*

The Sims didn't succeed *despite* being led by women and welcoming everyone.

It succeeded *because* of it.

---

## The Patrick Kelly Leak (2012-2013)

> *The most significant leak in Sims franchise history, revealing The Sims 4 was originally an online game*

### The Discovery

In April 2012, SimsVIP received an anonymous email pointing them to Patrick Kelly's personal website (pkellysf.com), which contained pre-production screenshots from The Sims 4. Kelly had worked as a UI/UX Designer at Maxis from May 2005 until he was "let go" in March 2012. SimsVIP wrote:

> *"The website was since deleted after EA was notified of the 'leak'."*

But the story didn't end there. A few months later, a group called "Siminati" found Kelly's website *again* and began posting videos and sharing emails that revealed details about a new Sims title.

### What the Leak Revealed

- **Project Olympus:** The Sims 4 was originally developed as an **internet-based multiplayer game** from 2008-2012
- **Project Icarus:** A codename for another online Sims concept being "explored, not necessarily developed"
- **Development Timeline:** 4+ years of online development before the concept was scrapped
- **Pivot to Offline:** The online version was abandoned due to connection issues, quality problems, and multiplayer limitations

### Corroboration from LinkedIn

After The Sims 4 was officially announced, multiple Maxis employees' LinkedIn profiles confirmed Kelly's claims:

| Name | Title | LinkedIn Evidence |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Brian Neal** | Senior Software Engineer | "Lead Systems Engineer — The Sims 4 (2014)" with tenure from "August 2008 – Present" |
| **Gil Colgate** | Senior Engineer | "Got to work on clustered servers, chat systems, scaling and performance, and other **internet style stuff when it was an internet based game**. Also became python internals guru." |
| **Lori Schilling** | Senior Project Lead | "PROJECT: **Olympus**, Sims 4" |
| **Brian Bell** | Senior Software Engineer | "working on an unannounced Sims-franchise title" with both "Unannounced Sims Project" and "The Sims 4" listed |

Gil Colgate's profile is particularly damning — it explicitly references "internet style stuff when it was an internet based game."

### Patrick Kelly's Mod The Sims Q&A

Kelly created an account on Mod The Sims and started a Q&A thread (later deleted). From archived transcripts:

**On EA and Maxis:**
> *"EA isn't 'the evil empire' or anything like that. The Sims label especially is full of really talented creative people who will more than likely deliver an awesome TS4 game in 2014. Generally the problems come from upper management who control the budget. There is a constant struggle between the designers and producers trying to get every great new feature possible into the game and the management who want to cut costs and deliver the game as soon as possible."*

**On the Online-to-Offline Pivot:**
> *"TS4 development has been going on for many years. The big thing that changed was dropping online for offline. They were most likely able to keep the parts that didn't require online though like CAS and Build/Buy."*

**On the Push for Online:**
> *"The push for online comes mostly from the marketing and business side of the business. It's much easier to sell you customized products in the store if they are able to track you 'live' while you are playing online."*

**On Character Design:**
> *"The characters go through many-many changes while the game is in development and while I have no idea what they will look like when the game comes out, I can guarantee you they will not look like the ones in the images you saw. Especially now that the game is offline, the designers will be adding more detail to the models, clothing, accessories, and objects in the game world."*

**On Project Codenames:**
> *"When a game is in development it is given an internal 'code-name'. It's a name that is used internally and generally is never associated with the final name of the game. For instance, when I was working on Sims2 Castaway, the 'code-name' was 'Stranded'. So 'Icarus' was just a code-name given to a game being explored, not necessarily developed."*

**On User Interface Focus:**
> *"User Interaction is a MAJOR focus of TS4. They really want to make playing the game a fun and enjoyable experience, not a hassle… Maxis has some extremely talented UI/UX designers who will be making sure concerns like yours are addressed."*

**On The Sims' Online Track Record:**
> *"You may be right. Sims has never really done online well. Hopefully by scaling it back for TS4 they will be able to implement it correctly."*

### The Controversial Email

Kelly's most inflammatory statement came from an email he exchanged with a fan (screenshot archived):

> *"From what I am told, the game is a mess, the studio is a mess, and people are frustrated to the point of rebelling. Making video games is not as glamorous as people think [it is], it's actually cut-throat, but the current generation of designers has taken it to a new level. The most obvious clue they are making now is the [The] Sims 4 logo, which looks like it was made in just a minute and produced by a clueless committee of designers."*

### Kelly's Erratic Behavior

The leak took a strange turn as Kelly's behavior became increasingly erratic:

> *"My other frustration came from receiving agressive emails and reading negative posts calling me a scammer, a liar, crazy, etc. The original post on this website was particularly damaging to me so I tried not to pay too much attention. But my 'creative' darker side came out so I thought if they think I'm crazy then I'll just post crazy stuff."*

This included posting a skull image, rapidly changing his website, and making cryptic references. When asked about the significance of a "red hat" image, he replied:

> *"The red hat is from David Thorne's article called 'Missing Missy'. It will have you ROTFL… http://www.27bslash6.com/missy.html"*

### Why EA Didn't Sue

A mystery that lingered in the community:

> *"This is also the reason why I wondered so much when Patrick Kelly leaked his information because he couldn't have avoided to know that EA could sue him for maybe everything he owned if he did so. So why did he do it anyway?"*

EA apparently chose not to pursue legal action, possibly because:
- The information was already widely distributed
- A lawsuit would confirm the leaks
- Kelly was no longer employed and had limited assets

### The Aftermath

Kelly eventually deleted:
- His pkellysf.com website
- His LinkedIn profile
- His Mod The Sims account

But the archived information lived on in fan forums, Tumblr posts (honeywellsims4news), and news sites.

### MOOLLM Relevance

The Kelly saga illustrates several principles MOOLLM addresses:

| Issue | MOOLLM Solution |
|-------|-----------------|
| Online-only creates dependencies | Filesystem-first, works offline |
| Corporate tracking concerns | Local files, user ownership |
| Pivot from online to offline mid-development | Architecture works either way |
| Tension between designers and management | Community-driven, open source |
| Information wants to be free | Open source from day one |
| Community passion (Kelly: "I had no idea people were so passionate about The Sims") | Embrace community, don't fight it |

## The Sims 4 Gender Inclusivity

> *"Female Sims can wear sharp men's suits like Ellen [DeGeneres] and male Sims can wear heels like Prince."*
> — Rachel Franklin, 2016

### The 2016 Update

In June 2016, executive Rachel Franklin announced comprehensive gender inclusivity updates:

**Changes included:**
- Gender-neutral clothing options for all Sims
- Cross-dressing enabled ("male" Sims in dresses, "female" Sims in suits)
- Ability to customize pregnancy capability regardless of gender presentation
- Voice options decoupled from physical appearance
- Body customization (physique, walking style) across gender lines
- Ability to wear "opposite gender" clothing, hairstyles, and accessories

This was explicitly modeled on real-world examples — Ellen DeGeneres in suits, Prince in heels — making it clear the feature was about *personal expression*, not transgression.

### Senior Producer Michael Duke

After Grant Rodiek moved on, Michael Duke became Senior Producer for The Sims 4 (transitioning from The Sims Mobile):

> *"We're trying to make sure everyone can come into this game and create themselves."*

Duke explicitly acknowledged that "many things are yet to be covered" in making the game fully inclusive:

> *"Either by time or technical constraints, many things are yet to be covered to make sure that 'everyone can come into this game and create themselves.'"*

### The Community Divide

The gender update sparked significant controversy on The Sims forums. From archived forum posts:

**Critical Response (June 2016):**

> *"It started off small-little things that I would roll my eyes about when people got upset, like the 'It's on us' t-shirt. Now, it's about trans gender... Personally I don't mind your update that you did today, I am kinda excited to play with different styles on different characters. I'm totally not into the guys having babies with guys and gals having babies with gals but I am not offended by it's inclusion. The sims has always been a little off the rocker. ;)"*
>
> *"What I find completely disgusting is how you are using this subject for attention and sales. I find it disgusting that people who do not agree with the update are being called disgusting and rude and so on and so forth — and that they are being silenced. This makes me angry. What YOU as a company has done, has really made me very angry. YOU are using YOUR FANS — against each other, to create drama to sell your game."*

Another forum user wondered:

> *"I wonder if they added it now, due to the big news in the US about transgender bathrooms and such. If it is in the news it is a 'hot topic' so naturally the games would want to get in on the happenings of the day."*

**Supportive Response:**

The update was widely celebrated by LGBTQ+ players and allies. The sentiment was captured by a simple reply:

> *"Don't let the transgendered sims hit you on the way out! ;)"*

### Media Strategy

Some community members objected to EA's media strategy — immediately going to multiple media outlets with statements and interviews about the feature:

> *"It would be one thing if they pushed out this update, gave a small announcement on their own website regarding it, and left it at that. But what did they do? They immediately went to multiple media outlets, gave statements, small interviews, etc. all regarding this feature, and it almost feels like they did it for the attention."*

**Coverage included:**
- [Pink News](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/06/02/the-sims-adds-cross-dressing-as-male-and-female-limits-are-scrapped/)
- [Game Revolution](https://www.gamerevolution.com/news/587087-the-sims-4-inclusive-gender-system-going-further)
- Multiple gaming news outlets

### Leadership Transition

The gender update came during a period of significant leadership change:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2015-10 | Lucy Bradshaw leaves EA after 18 years |
| 2015-10 | Rachel Franklin promoted to VP/GM |
| 2016-06 | Gender inclusivity update launches |
| 2016-09 | Rachel Franklin leaves EA for Facebook VR |
| 2016-12 | Lyndsay Pearson becomes GM of The Sims |

### SimGuruDrake's Clarification

When community members speculated about Rachel Franklin's departure, SimGuruDrake (Community Manager) stated:

> *"Rachel 100% left of her own volition."*

And on future development direction:

> *"Plans for the game are set pretty much in stone far in advance."*

### MOOLLM Parallel

The gender inclusivity update aligns perfectly with MOOLLM's approach:

| The Sims 4 | MOOLLM |
|------------|--------|
| No gender-locked clothing | No identity constraints on characters |
| Self-expression options | Players define their own characters |
| Safe to explore identity | Room-based ethical framing |
| Not about "transgression" | Representation ethics skill |
| Framed around real examples (Ellen, Prince) | Tribute protocol for real people |

## The Maxis Emeryville Shutdown (2015)

> *"Everyone's out of a job."*
> — Guillaume Pierre, March 4, 2015

### The Closure

On March 4, 2015, EA shut down the Maxis Emeryville studio — the birthplace of SimCity and The Sims. The closure came in the aftermath of the disastrous SimCity (2013) launch and affected dozens of developers.

**Guillaume Pierre**, who had worked at Maxis for 12 years as a designer and lead gameplay scripter on SimCity (2013), confirmed the closure on Twitter:

> *"Everyone's out of a job."*

When pressed for details, Pierre responded that he couldn't provide further information "beyond that the studio is shutting down."

**Barrie Tingle**, a live producer on SimCity, also tweeted about the shutdown, posting a photo of the studio refrigerator:

> *"Maxis Emeryville closes as of today. [Refrigerator] stocked for the day with cheap malt liquor."*

### The Casualties

| Person | Role | Tenure |
|--------|------|--------|
| Guillaume Pierre | Designer, Lead Gameplay Scripter | 12 years (2003-2015) |
| Barrie Tingle | Live Producer | — |
| Patrick Buechner | VP & GM, Maxis Emeryville | 20 years (1995-2015) |
| Ocean Quigley | Senior Creative/Art Director | 20 years (1995-2015) |
| Many others | — | — |

### The Aftermath

Following the shutdown:
- Lucy Bradshaw departed EA in October 2015 after 18 years
- Rachel Franklin was promoted to VP/GM of Maxis
- The Sims development continued at other EA studios
- Several Maxis veterans went to form indie studios (Paralives developers trace lineage here)

### Why It Happened

The SimCity (2013) debacle was the proximate cause:
- Always-online requirement failed at launch
- Server issues made the game unplayable for days
- Mandatory online for a traditionally offline franchise
- Critics and players revolted
- Lucy Bradshaw defended the online requirement, then quietly walked it back

A forum user summarized the community feeling:

> *"The people responsible for making Sims 4 and to an extent SimCity 2013 (Bradshaw) had to be removed before they could destroy Maxis entirely."*

### The Survivors

The Sims franchise survived the shutdown. Development continued, and the franchise remains profitable. The current leadership (Lyndsay Pearson) emerged from within the ranks, representing continuity despite corporate disruption.

---

## The Facebook VR Exodus

> *Both Lucy Bradshaw and Rachel Franklin ended up at Facebook leading VR projects*

### Lucy Bradshaw

After leaving EA in October 2015, Lucy Bradshaw joined Facebook (later Meta) to work on social VR:

- **18 years at Maxis/EA** as Vice President
- Led The Sims 2 development  
- Oversaw the controversial SimCity (2013)
- Joined Facebook's VR division

### Rachel Franklin

When Rachel Franklin left EA in September 2016, she followed Bradshaw to Facebook:

- **5+ years at Maxis/EA** as Executive Producer and VP/GM
- Championed The Sims 4 gender inclusivity
- Joined Facebook to "lead social VR team"

From the announcement:

> *"Facebook plans to launch social VR offering as soon as possible."*

Franklin was specifically hired to lead a team creating a "Social VR game" — essentially bringing her Sims experience to virtual reality.

### MOOLLM Relevance

The VR exodus illustrates a pattern: talented people leave corporate structures to pursue new platforms. MOOLLM exists in this tradition — pursuing what corporate structures won't support.

## The 2018 Layoffs

### Multiple SimGurus Laid Off

In April 2018, multiple Sims developers were let go, with others moved to mobile teams:

**SimGuruDaniel** left Maxis, prompting community concern.

**Community Response:**

> *"Multiple Sims developers have been let go... others moved to mobile teams."*

**SimGuru Response:**

The remaining SimGurus tried to calm community fears:

> *"We need to stop assuming this decision was made by the powers-that-be and accept that [people] simply found better offers."*

### The Mobile Shift

The layoffs coincided with a strategic shift toward mobile gaming at EA:
- The Sims Mobile launched
- Resources redirected from PC development
- Community frustration grew

### Grant Rodiek to Michael Duke

The Senior Producer transition from Grant Rodiek to Michael Duke happened around this time:

> *"I want to welcome @SimGuruDuke to TS4! Joining us from TSM [The Sims Mobile], he'll be our Sr Producer for TS4! Don't worry, @SimGuruGrant is still working on a number of important and awesome Maxis things."*
> — Lyndsay Pearson (@SimGuruLyndsay)

---

## BBC Documentary (2025)

Jess Bird, a writer working with BBC Studios on a documentary about The Sims, reached out in April 2025:

> *"I was seven when The Sims came out, and that Summer I discovered a portal into another world. One where I felt like a God, and not like a shy, clueless kid. I was so obsessed with it that I drew the game interface on a piece of paper and 'played' it under the covers after I'd been sent to bed."*
>
> — Jess Bird, BBC Studios

This sparked correspondence about the evolution from The Sims to MOOLLM:

> *"This in no way is meant to do your job for you or replace you with AI, because it's based on YOU and would NOT work WITHOUT you. It's interactive Fan Simulation that you can talk and play with (and write code and make web pages with too)!"*

**The Documentary Framing:**
The exclusivity agreement for The Sims documentary explicitly excludes MOOLLM:

> *"I am ok with the exclusivity agreement, as long as it's ok for me to documentary-ify other stuff that's not The Sims, specifically the LLOOOOMM character system AI system I'm developing — which does simulate characters and was inspired by The Sims, but goes a lot further and does a lot more things than were possible back then in 1997."*

---

## Ben Shneiderman's Wisdom

Ben Shneiderman, Don's mentor at the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab, provided feedback on project vision:

> *"The heart of a [crowdfunding] pitch is that you want to do something which the current market structures will not support... You need to describe who your game is designed for and why it is different from other games."*
>
> *"Donors want to know more than that they are helping you realize your goal. They want to share your vision and have common purpose with you. You need to convey more than just why you want to do this, but why they should want you to do this."*
>
> — Ben Shneiderman, February 2014

Ben's insight applies directly to MOOLLM: it's not about funding, it's about **shared vision**. MOOLLM exists because market structures don't support this kind of deep, philosophical, educational exploration of what LLMs can become.

## Early Experiments: Lessons in Representation Ethics

> ⚠️ **Historical Note:** This section documents an early, exploratory phase of development before the ethical frameworks now codified in MOOLLM were fully developed. These experiments — having LLM-generated text appear to speak "as" real people — raised important questions about consent, representation, and the difference between tribute and impersonation.

In early 2025, experiments with character simulation included having the LLM generate dialogue "as" real people. While technically impressive, this approach conflated **what someone might say** with **what they actually said**, creating ethical concerns:

| Problem | MOOLLM's Solution |
|---------|-------------------|
| Putting words in real people's mouths | [Tribute Protocol](./MOOLLM-EVAL-INCARNATE-FRAMEWORK.md#ethical-representation-the-tribute-protocol) — explicit framing as imagination |
| No consent mechanism | [representation-ethics](../skills/representation-ethics/) — right to self-definition |
| Unclear what's real vs. simulated | Room-based ethical framing inheritance |
| Potential for misattribution | `CARD.yml` with built-in respect policies |

**Key Insight:** The early experiments demonstrated the *capability* but also revealed the *responsibility*. MOOLLM now requires:

1. **Explicit Framing:** "This is what we imagine they might say" not "This is what they said"
2. **Right to Edit:** Real people can review and modify their own character files
3. **Tribute, Not Claim:** Simulations are presented as loving tributes, not documentary
4. **Inherited Ethics:** Rooms/contexts declare their framing, child content inherits it

See [`representation-ethics`](../skills/representation-ethics/) and the [Tribute Protocol](./MOOLLM-EVAL-INCARNATE-FRAMEWORK.md#ethical-representation-the-tribute-protocol).

---

## The Ethical Framework: Fan Simulation

From the early LLOOOOMM credits, the ethical approach to simulating real people:

> **Important Disclaimer:** This is a work of Fan Simulation — like Fan Fiction that you can talk and play with! The characters' words aren't necessarily their own actual quotes, but their simulations were trained on a delicious stew of their real words, my words, Hacker News posts, emails with and about them, discussions, Wikipedia articles, and the collective consciousness of the internet.

> **Your Right to Self-Definition:** Anyone represented here (or their families, survivors, and legacy librarians) has the absolute right to see and edit their own character file (.md markup document) and soul file (.yaml document). This is YOUR right to self-definition, expression, and privacy. If you want to correct, expand, redact, or completely rewrite how you're represented in LLOOOOMM, just reach out. Your voice matters more than my simulation of it!

**MOOLLM Parallel:** This ethical framework is codified in:
- [`representation-ethics`](../skills/representation-ethics/) skill
- The Tribute Protocol
- `CARD.yml` with built-in respect policies
- Room-based ethical framing inheritance

## On Appreciation and Support

This project represents significant personal investment — time, energy, money, and decades of accumulated knowledge. The work speaks for itself. It's not built for profit but for the joy of creation and the hope that it advances human-computer interaction.

If you find value in these ideas, the best support is:
- **Using them** — Fork the repo, run your own adventures
- **Extending them** — Write skills, create characters, build worlds
- **Sharing them** — Tell others who might benefit
- **Contributing** — Patreon donations, institutional support

The tokens cost money. The cursor bills add up. But the work continues because it matters.
