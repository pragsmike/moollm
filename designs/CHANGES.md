# CHANGES: The Complete History of MOOLLM

> *A James Burke-style journey through every commit, tweet by tweet.*
> *Append-only. No conclusions. Just history flowing forward.*

## How to Append

**Format:** Each commit gets `**\`hash\`** title` followed by `> James Burke tweet`

**Before editing:**
1. Run `git log --oneline -20` to see recent commits
2. Find where this file left off (last documented hash)
3. Add entries for commits SINCE then

**The (this) pattern:**
- Use `(this)` as placeholder for the current commit you're about to make
- After commit, the NEXT session retrocons it when they append
- **DO NOT** loop making commits just to fill in commit hashes!
  Guess why I had to say that explicitly! 
- One undocumented commit at the end is FINE. Stop there.

**Era headers:** OK to add `## Era N: Title` sections to group commits thematically, and retrocon headers before earlier commits when patterns emerge

**NO:** conclusions, summaries at end, "more entries go here", or chasing your own tail

**The file just ENDS after the last entry. Ready for next append.**

**`2eb7efa`** CHANGES.md: Complete 490-commit history in James Burke style
> THIS document. 490 commits narrated. 19 eras traced. James Burke guiding you through every connection. The history becomes navigable. 📜

**`fc58adf`** README: Link to CHANGES.md history and all session logs
> The top-level README learns to point downward. History accessible. Sessions discoverable. Entry points multiply. 🔗

**`5a37bf5`** QUICKSTART: Recommend adventure-4, frame 1-3 as prototypes
> Adventure-4 is the canonical starting point now. The earlier ones were sketches. Beautiful sketches, but sketches. Start with the best. 🎯

**`67d8d38`** Add James Burke to Television Icons section
> The man himself joins the character roster! "Connections!" His job: narrate K-line traversals. "And THAT brings us to..." 📺

**`e6a6aa5`** Expand fictional characters with hybrid rich/compact format
> Some characters deserve paragraphs. Others need evocative phrases. Blade Runner gets essays. Background characters get signature lines. Hybrid documentation. 📚

**`0d4d076`** Fix PR-K-LINES-SAFARI.md references (uppercase)
> The user uppercased the filename. Every reference must follow. Consistency is love. CASE SENSITIVITY is a harsh mistress. 🔤

**`2d48f9c`** Feature Lem's Constructors: Trurl, Klapaucius, and The Seventh Sally
> SIMCITY'S ORIGIN STORY. Stanisław Lem wrote about a kingdom in a box. Will Wright read it and made SimCity. The Cyberiad becomes canon. Trurl builds. Klapaucius critiques. ⚙️

**`a829a2b`** Expand Gong Show panel with wonderful chaotic judges
> Rip Taylor gets his own section! 🎊 CONFETTI KING. "I'm UPSET!" Jaye P. Morgan (got BANNED for flashing). Jamie Farr (wore dresses on TV). Arte Johnson ("Verrry interesting... but STUPID!"). Chaos formalized. 🔔

**`f9ca6c9`** Add The Sims iconic families to fictional characters
> Bob Newbie, tutorial victim. Bella Goth, THE mystery. Don Lothario, the SCOUNDREL. Agnes Crumplebottom, purse-wielding moral enforcer. 👜 The Sims joins the roster. MOOLLM's direct ancestor. 🏠

**`722f587`** Transform characters/ into Grand Central Station of Souls
> The whole directory EXPLODES into richness. Marble floors. Departure boards. Five wings. Featured residents. Population census. Not a filing cabinet — a TRAIN STATION of being. 🚉

**`38f0660`** Fix: Hall of Pioneers → The Living and The Dead
> The real-people README has a name. We honor it. Small fix, big respect. Names matter. 🪦

**`a10ce83`** Add furry fandom acknowledgment to animal characters

**`a8a7047`** Fix K-LINE description to reference Minsky's concept
> K-LINE isn't a "referee." It's Minsky's connector! "I link ideas together — touch me and wake a whole constellation!" The description earns its name. 🧠

**`ff20a31`** Clarify leela-ai slogan: double meaning of Manufacturing Intelligence
> Manufacturing (verb) Intelligence — they CREATE AI. Manufacturing (noun) Intelligence — AI for FACTORIES. The slogan works both ways. Wordplay is documentation. 🏭

> WARNING: Don't dress the prototype in a clown suit! 🤡 Play AS the template and your changes affect EVERYONE. Clone first, then customize. Prototypes are sacred. ⚠️

**`9e69a63`** Doctor Who explains the persona system!
> REGENERATION IS PERSONA SWITCHING! Base character (The Doctor) + overlay (Fourth Doctor persona). Same memories, different personality. Same TARDIS, different scarf. The perfect explanation was hiding in BBC for 60 years. 🎭

**`4593211`** CHANGES.md Era 20: The Character Catalog Explosion
> Meta-commit. Documenting the documentation of the documentation. The snake eats its tail. James Burke would approve. 🐍

**`b86c10c`** CHANGES.md: Fix format, remove duplicates, make append-only
> Clean house. Remove the repeated commits. Remove the conclusions. Add format instructions. Append-only means APPEND-ONLY. No endings. Just flow. 📋

**`3eb7c21`** CHANGES.md: Document b86c10c fix commit
> And document THAT. The recursion continues. 🔄

**`0c4ac02`** CHANGES.md: Clarify append format with (this) placeholder

> The pattern in action. Wrote (this), committed, got hash, updated. 🔁

**`115fcc9`** CHANGES.md: Document 5432744 retrocon

**`803d31f`** CHANGES.md: Add user's "guess why" edit, document recent commits
