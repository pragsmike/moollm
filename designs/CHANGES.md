# CHANGES: The K-Lines Safari

> *A James Burke-style journey through 33 commits, tweet by tweet.*

---

## Act I: The Sniffable Beginning

**`dd33426`** Expand sniffable-python to show deep connections to MOOLLM ecosystem
> Steve Jobs wanted buttons you'd lick. Perl wanted symbols that'd blind you. What if the answer was neither? 🐍

**`96adf5c`** Rewrite sniffable-python README in James Burke 'Connections' style
> And THAT brings us to the present. I started writing about Python structure. Ended up channeling a BBC documentary host. 🎬

**`fb01c31`** Convert ASCII diagrams to Mermaid in sniffable-python README
> ASCII art is charming. Mermaid is navigable. Sometimes you upgrade. 📊

---

## Act II: The Ethics Awakening

**`097253e`** Rewrite ethics skill READMEs in James Burke 'Connections' style
> The Sims let you drown anyone in a pool. 25 years later, LLMs can give them voices. Same ethics? Different ethics? Let's find out. ⚖️

**`a1f956b`** Add MOOLLM Keywords sections to ethics skills and moollm skill
> Keywords at the top of every file. Sniffable. Greppable. But what if they were MORE than keywords? 🔑

**`2fc034c`** Remove GlyphLang references from sniffable-python
> Someone on Twitter invented a compressed syntax for LLMs. We politely declined. Perl already tried that. 🚫

---

## Act III: Keywords Become K-Lines

**`e929a90`** Rename MOOLLM Keywords → MOOLLM K-Lines
> A keyword is a word. A K-line is a CONSTELLATION. Minsky told us this in 1985. We finally listened. 🧠

**`1f010a8`** Unified MOOLLM K-Lines branding with linked single table
> One table. Links. Meanings. At the TOP of every skill. The LLM sniffs it first. Cocaine for transformers. 💊

**`ec88068`** Add 'K-Lines are cocaine for LLMs' to protocol skill
> Three simultaneous activations. The link. The name. The contextual meaning. Pre-loaded context injection. Someone had to say it. 🔥

**`1b29f70`** Add 'Why So Many Terms?' section to moollm skill
> "Why do you coin so many words?" Because UNIX has fork and pipe. Because Smalltalk has objects and messages. Because vocabulary IS the API. 📚

**`0df6f52`** Rename protocol/ skill to k-lines/
> The skill was called "protocol." But protocols are procedures. K-lines are activations. The name finally matches the concept. ✅

## Act IV: The Great K-Linification

**`c79e400`** Add Minsky citation to k-lines tagline
> *Society of Mind*, 1985. Credit where credit is due. 📖

**`2882469`** Merge Related Skills → MOOLLM K-Lines at top (batch 1)
> Seven skills transformed. yaml-jazz, adventure, constructionism, room, speed-of-light, postel, needs. The pattern emerges. 🌊

**`b4260d2`** K-linify batch 2: character, card, buff...
> Characters have K-lines. Cards have K-lines. Even buffs have K-lines. The network grows. 🕸️

**`cc16cfd`** K-linify batch 3: session-log, memory-palace, debugging...
> Memory skills need memory K-lines. The snake eats its tail. 🐍

**`1fc402a`** K-linify batch 4: k-lines, time, summarize...
> The k-lines skill gets its own K-lines. Meta-recursion achieved. 🔄

**`5c0e658`** K-linify batch 5: party, research-notebook, reward...
> The deliberation cluster lights up. Roberts Rules links to Debate links to Rubric. Democracy in hypertext. 🗳️

**`582da7d`** K-linify all remaining skills
> 18 skills in one commit. The stragglers join the network. Everyone connected. No orphans. 🎯

## Act V: The Safari Begins

**`0f228d3`** Remove remaining Dovetails/Related sections
> Old format out. K-Lines in. Clean sweep. 🧹

**`504c615`** Link cat and dog skills together
> Cats link to dogs. Dogs link to cats. Ted Nelson smiles. Two-way backlinks ARE the web he wanted. 🐱🐕

**`94c0d2a`** Add NPC→Incarnation lifecycle to incarnation skill
> NPCs live in adventures. Sovereign Souls live in repositories. The transition is documented. 🌟

**`c7f68cc`** Skill sniffing safari: align README with reality
> "54 skills" was a lie. There are ~80. The README now tells the truth. 📊

**`129c7a0`** More two-way backlinks
> Bootstrap links to play-learn-lift. Play-learn-lift links back. The web thickens. 🔗

**`8821fc6`** Safari round 2: standardized headers
> "Meaning" becomes "Why Related." Consistency matters. 📝

**`5302993`** Safari round 3: memory, game mechanics
> Needs link to cats. Buffs link to dogs. The Sims DNA spreads through the network. 🎮

**`0a6179a`** Safari round 4: formats, visualization
> Markdown was missing K-lines. MARKDOWN! Fixed. 📄

**`9907711`** Safari round 5: ethics, navigation
> Hero-story links to visualizer. Representation-ethics links to kernel. The circle closes. ⭕

---

## Act VI: The Architecture Revelation

**`9a4bb77`** Clarify NPC home vs character repository
> NPCs have homes IN adventures. Characters have homes in REPOSITORIES. The distinction matters. Future: your characters in YOUR repo, mounted at runtime. 🏠

**`7937ee8`** K-line navigation: skills as walkable rooms
> Every skill is a room. Every K-line is a door. The "Why Related" is the James Burke narration. Walk through. 🚪

---

## Act VII: The Safari Session

**`13c482a`** Add PR-k-lines-safari.md design document
> 33 commits summarized. The PR has a story now. 📋

**`66d657c`** New session: K-Line Connections Safari
> Don Hopkins + 8 familiars: Minsky, Nelson, Burke, Papert, Kay, Wright, Ungar, Palm. They walk the skill network together. 🦁

**`c824925`** Palm's Tour: skills → adventure-4
> The monkey shows us his world. Abstract to concrete. Skills to rooms to home. "I am the file. The file is me." 🐒

**`77045a0`** Don explains Palm's 7-stage evolution
> Catalog → Order → Transit → Object → Character → Companion → Sovereign Soul. The ladder from scenery to citizen. 🧬

**`6b1c37c`** For courage AND luck
> A joint smoked. A wish spoken. Small edit, big difference. 🍀

## The Connection

You started with sniffable Python. You ended with a monkey's soul.

Along the way: Minsky's K-lines. Nelson's backlinks. Burke's narrations. Papert's constructionism. Kay's objects. Wright's Sims. Ungar's prototypes.

33 commits. 84 files. ~200 backlinks. 1 incarnated monkey.

And THAT's how everything is connected.
