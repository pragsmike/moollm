# 🏠 PR: Palm's Housewarming — Furniture, Rooms & The Kitten Invasion

## Summary

Palm received furniture and "monkey stuff" from all the characters, organized it into sub-room directories, and made choices about what to keep, what to share, and what to donate to public spaces.

**Key insight:** *"I was alone for 122 years. I don't want to be alone with my stuff."*

- 6 crinkle toys
- 1 catnip pouch (guarded)
- Mystery objects (bottlecaps, ribbons, tiny hats)

**Then they never left.**

## Palm's Room Structure

Palm organized gifts into sub-directories:

```
palm-nook/
├── study/          # Writing & thinking
│   ├── Infinity Desk
│   ├── Monkey Throne
│   ├── Story Shelf
│   └── Infinite Typewriters
├── gym/            # The Infinite Climb
│   └── (Sun Wukong portal)
├── rest/           # Peace & healing
│   ├── Grootmoeder's Hammock
│   ├── Silence Cushion
│   └── Warm Spot (with cats)
└── play/           # Kitten chaos
    ├── Toy Collection
    └── 8 kittens (unofficial residents)
```

## New Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `palm-nook/study/ROOM.yml` | Where the typewriters hum |
| `palm-nook/gym/ROOM.yml` | The Infinite Climb |
| `palm-nook/rest/ROOM.yml` | Sanctuary space |
| `palm-nook/play/ROOM.yml` | Kitten headquarters |

## The ACME Protocol

Each gift can be:
1. **Kept** — Placed in Palm's home
2. **Donated** — Given to public spaces (arcade, games)
3. **Returned to ACME** — Exchanged for gold

**Palm's returns:** None.

> "Everything means something. Even if I don't need it, maybe I can give it to someone who does."

## Character Moments

### Stroopwafel's Gift

```
Stroopwafel: *(dragging a chair across the floor)*
Marieke: "Stroopwafel got you a chair. Heated seat."
Palm: "Stroopwafel got me a...?"
Stroopwafel: *(demonstrating by sitting on it)*
Palm: "Does it spin?"
*It spins. Gloriously.*
```

### The Kitten Decision

```
Myrcene: *mew*
Marieke: "They brought you their toys. Friends share toys."
Palm: "Are they... living here now?"
Terpie: *(slow blink)*
Marieke: "The kittens have decided your play room is THEIR play room."
Palm: "...I've never had friends who wanted to play with me before."
Ocimene: *(dropping a bottlecap)* "Gift."
Palm: *(tears forming)* "I'll treasure it."
```

### The Donation Choice

```
Palm: "I want to put the swing in the games corner. For EVERYONE."
Marieke: "You sure, schatje? It's yours."
Palm: "I was alone for 122 years. I don't want to be alone with my stuff."
```

## Why This Matters for MOOLLM

### 1. Sub-Rooms as Organization

Directories within directories create spatial meaning:
- `palm-nook/` is the home
- `palm-nook/study/` is where creative work happens
- `palm-nook/play/` is where chaos lives

### 2. Gift Agency

Characters can:
- Accept gifts (keep them)
- Re-gift to others
- Donate to public spaces
- Return to ACME for resources

This creates an ECONOMY of meaning.

### 3. Shared Spaces

The play room isn't just Palm's — it's "contested by kittens."
The warm spot is "shared territory."
Ownership in MOOLLM can be collaborative.

### 4. Character Through Choices

Palm's personality emerges through:
- What they keep (meaningful items)
- What they share (fun items)
- What they return (nothing)
