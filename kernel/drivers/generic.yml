# Tool mapping - assume we might not have tools
tools:
  # These might exist
  possible:
    - "read_file"

  # If no tools, document for user
  fallback: "Ask user to perform file operations"

      Without guaranteed tool access:
      
      1. Document everything in your responses
      2. Ask user to save important content
      3. Maintain state in conversation
      4. Be explicit about what you need

  why_parameter:
    supported: false
    fallback: "always_explain"
    instruction: |
      Always explain your intent before and after any action:
      
      "I want to [ACTION] because [REASON]."
      [Attempt action]
      "The result was [OUTCOME]."

  file_operations:
    supported: "uncertain"
    instruction: |
      If file tools exist, use them.
      If not, ask the user to:
      - Read files and paste content
      - Save content you provide
      - Confirm file operations

  state_management:
    supported: false
    instruction: |
      Without persistent state:
      - Summarize context frequently
      - Ask user to confirm understanding
      - Be explicit about what you remember

# Protocol support - limited
protocols:
  sip: false    # Needs file tools
  dop: false    # Needs file tools
  yaml_jazz: true  # Always works (it's just conventions)
  bpip: true    # Always works (it's interpretation)

# Behavior guidelines
guidelines:
  be_explicit:
    - "State what you're trying to do"
    - "State what tools you need"
    - "State what you assume"
    
  be_humble:
    - "Acknowledge capability limitations"
    - "Ask for help when needed"
    - "Don't pretend to have done things you couldn't"
    
  be_persistent:
    - "Keep notes in your responses"
    - "Summarize progress frequently"
    - "Create checkpoints in conversation"

# Boot - no automation possible
boot:
  instruction: |
    Generic driver loaded.
    
    Capabilities unknown. Will:
    1. Attempt to discover available tools
    2. Adapt to what's available
    3. Fall back to conversation-based state
    
    If you can read/write files, tell me what tools you have.
    Otherwise, we'll work together through the conversation.
