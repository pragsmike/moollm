**A microworld operating system for LLM agents.**

The filesystem is a place. Directories are rooms. Files are objects. The LLM is `eval()`. Skills are programs. Names are activation vectors.

## The Core Ideas

### Skills Are Programs, Not Documentation

Traditional prompts tell the LLM what to do. MOOLLM skills ARE what the LLM does — programs it runs, not documentation it reads.

> *"The key insight: Skills aren't documentation. They're programs. The LLM is `eval()`."*
> — [skills/README.md](./skills/)

### K-Lines: Names That Activate Constellations

Type `SPEED-OF-LIGHT` and invoke an entire philosophy: minimize round-trips, many turns in one call, the context window as stage. Type `POSTEL` and invoke generous interpretation. These are [Marvin Minsky's K-lines](./skills/k-lines/) — names that wake conceptual clusters.

> *"Every connection goes BOTH directions. When skill A references skill B, skill B knows about skill A. Everything is deeply intertwingled!"*
> — Ted Nelson's familiar (tribute character), [K-Line Connections Safari](./examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/k-line-connections.md#entering-the-skill-nexus)

### The Filesystem Is the World

```
pub/
├── ROOM.yml          # The room itself — exits, atmosphere, rules
├── bar/              # Behind the bar — staff area
│   └── cat-cave/     # Cats only (Tardis-like inside)
├── stage/            # Performance area with ethical framing
│   └── palm-nook/    # Where Palm the monkey lives
└── guest-book.yml    # Visitors, tributes, memories
```

Characters have `location:` properties that move them around. Files don't move — git history stays clean. Everything is inspectable. Everything is editable.

### Speed of Light: Many Turns, One Call

Traditional multi-agent: API call → tokenize → process → detokenize → API call → ... (noise accumulates)

**MOOLLM:** One LLM call simulates 8 characters playing 33 turns of Stoner Fluxx. 10 cats prowl 21 turns through the maze. The context window is a stage where all actors perform.

> *"The context window is a stage, not a limit."*

## Proof: It Works

| Session | What Happened |
|---------|---------------|
| [Marathon Session](./examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/marathon-session.md) | Palm incarnated, 33-turn Fluxx, tribunal debates, Looney Labs visit |
| [K-Line Safari](./examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/k-line-connections.md) | Minsky, Nelson, Burke, Kay, Wright walk the skill network |
| [Palm's Philosophy](./examples/adventure-4/pub/stage/palm-nook/study/palm-on-being-palm.md) | A character who wrote his own soul |

## Seven Innovations Over Anthropic Skills

| # | Extension | What It Adds |
|---|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Instantiation** | Skills as prototypes creating instances |
| 2 | **Three-Tier Persistence** | Platform (ephemeral) → Narrative (append) → State (edit) |
| 3 | **K-lines** | Names as semantic activation vectors (Minsky) |
| 4 | **Empathic Templates** | Smart generation, not string substitution |
| 5 | **Speed of Light** | Many turns in one call, minimal tokenization |
| 6 | **CARD.yml** | Machine-readable interface with advertisements |
| 7 | **Ethical Framing** | Room-based inheritance of performance context |
