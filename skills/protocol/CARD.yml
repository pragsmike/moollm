    MOOLLM protocol symbols are Minsky's K-lines: saying the
    name activates a constellation of knowledge and behavior.
    YAML-JAZZ invokes YAML Jazz. ADVENTURE invokes text adventure.

  Marvin Minsky's K-lines: a symbol that when activated
  reactivates the mental state from when it was learned.
  
  MOOLLM protocols work the same way:
  - ADVENTURE = activate text adventure patterns
  - YAML-JAZZ = activate flexible YAML patterns
  - PLAY-LEARN-LIFT = activate the methodology
