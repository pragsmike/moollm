# PROTOCOL — K-Lines Made Greppable

  description: >
    Protocol names ARE Minsky's K-lines — symbolic activators that invoke
    entire constellations of knowledge, skills, and behavior.
    UPPER-CASE-HYPHENATED format makes them findable.
  
  naming_convention:
    case: "UPPER-CASE"
    separator: "hyphen"
    examples:
      - "YAML-JAZZ"
      - "PLAY-LEARN-LIFT"
      - "POSTEL"
      - "COHERENCE-ENGINE"
    not_like_wikipedia: "No colons (WP:FOO) — just the symbol"
  
  why_this_convention:
    grep_friendly: "Unambiguous text search across all files"
    vector_friendly: "Distinct embeddings for semantic search"
    human_scannable: "Pops out in prose, impossible to miss"
    self_documenting: "Name describes the concept"
  
  layers:
    kernel:
      location: "kernel/"
      examples: ["FILES-AS-STATE", "WHY-REQUIRED", "APPEND-ONLY"]
      nature: "Fundamental, always active"
      
    skill:
      location: "skills/"
      examples: ["PLAY-LEARN-LIFT", "SOUL-CHAT", "POSTEL"]
      nature: "Behavioral patterns, invoked as needed"
      
    ad_hoc:
      location: "Anywhere — inline in documents"
      examples: ["KITCHEN-RULES", "GRUE-SAFE", "FOOD-CHAIN"]
      nature: "Emergent, informal, naming makes them real"
  
  where_protocols_live:
    central_registry: "PROTOCOLS.yml — master list"
    embedded: "Inline in files where used"
    referenced: "Just mentioned in prose"
    note: "The name IS the definition until formalized"
  
  lifecycle:
    - "Mentioned in chat → exists informally"
    - "Added to PROTOCOLS.yml → documented"
    - "Gets a skill directory → formalized"
    - "Gets templates → fully crystallized"
    - "Gets sister-script (LIFT) → automated"
  
  commands:
    - symbol: PROTOCOL
      args: "[name]"
      action: "Describe or invoke a protocol"
      
    - symbol: PROTOCOLS
      action: "List defined protocols"
      
    - symbol: DEFINE-PROTOCOL
      args: "[name]"
      action: "Add to PROTOCOLS.yml"
  
  invokes:
    - k-line         # Minsky — name activates tradition
    - greppable      # Easy to find with text search
    - constructionism # Naming is building

# The UPPER-CASE convention makes protocols:
# - Impossible to miss in prose
# - Trivial to find with search
# - Self-documenting handles on ideas
