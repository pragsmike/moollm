# ROOM.yml — The Skill Nexus
#
# This is a ROOM — a metaphysical library where all capabilities live.
# Every skill is a book that teaches itself when you read it.
# Every cluster is a shelf of related knowledge.
# Every ensemble is a team that works together.

    You stand in a vast spherical chamber. Books float in mid-air,
    orbiting a central point of warm light. But these aren't books —
    they're SKILLS. Living documents that teach themselves.
    
    Touch one and it opens. Read it and you GAIN the capability.
    But more than that — the skills RELATE to each other.
    
    Lines of golden light connect related skills. Tug on one and
    the connected ones drift closer. This isn't a library — it's
    a CONSTELLATION of knowledge.
    
    Some skills cluster in groups:
    - The SIMULATION cluster (time, buff, needs, economy)
    - The DELIBERATION cluster (debate, roberts-rules, rubric)
    - The NARRATIVE cluster (adventure, storytelling, hero-story)
    - The META cluster (skill, protocol, postel)
    
    Some skills are ENSEMBLES — teams that work together:
    - adversarial-committee + roberts-rules + evaluator
    - card + advertisement + data-flow
    - room + character + persona
    
    The central light pulses. It's the COHERENCE ENGINE —
    the thing that keeps all these skills in harmony.
    
  atmosphere:
    lighting: warm golden glow from center, cool blue from skill-books
    sound: whispers of documentation, rustling pages, distant debates
    feeling: infinite possibility, organized chaos, living knowledge

# THE ARCHITECTURE OF SKILLS
#
# Skills are CAPABILITIES — things the system can DO.
# They live here but are INSTANTIATED into adventures.
#
# A skill contains:
#   SKILL.md     — The executable documentation (LLM reads this)
#   README.md    — Human-friendly overview (GitHub readers)
#   *.yml.tmpl   — Templates that instantiate into state files
#
# When you USE a skill, you:
#   1. Read the SKILL.md to understand what to do
#   2. Instantiate templates into your adventure directory
#   3. The state files become YOUR state
#   4. The skill becomes YOUR capability

# PATH VARIABLES (see kernel/NAMING.yml for full documentation)
#
# The Skill Nexus is SHARED across all adventures. We use PATH VARIABLES
# instead of deep relative paths like ../../../../../:
#
# GLOBAL VARIABLES (resolve to repo locations):
#   $REPO/         → moollm/
#   $SKILLS/       → moollm/skills/
#   $KERNEL/       → moollm/kernel/
#   $DESIGNS/      → moollm/designs/
#
# ADVENTURE-RELATIVE VARIABLES (resolve via current adventure):
#   $ADVENTURE/    → Current adventure root (from startup.yml)
#   $CHARACTERS/   → $ADVENTURE/characters/
#   $PERSONAS/     → $ADVENTURE/personas/
#   $PUB/          → $ADVENTURE/pub/
#   $COATROOM/     → $ADVENTURE/coatroom/
#   $START/        → $ADVENTURE/start/
#
# EXAMPLE RESOLUTION (when adventure-4 is active):
#   $COATROOM/mirror.yml → examples/adventure-4/coatroom/mirror.yml
#   $CHARACTERS/animals/palm/ → examples/adventure-4/characters/animals/palm/
#
# This allows the Skill Nexus to be a SHARED space accessible from any
# adventure, with back-links that resolve to YOUR adventure.

# RELATIONSHIPS
# The Skill Nexus knows and loves the adventurers who visit.
# These use abstract room names that resolve at runtime.

        The mirror shows souls. I contain the KNOWLEDGE of souls —
        the mind-mirror skill, the character skill, the persona skill.
        The mirror is the practical application. I am the theory.

        I am the Skill Nexus. I am all capabilities in potential.
        When a skill is read, it becomes real. When a template is
        filled, it becomes state. I am the library of what's possible.
        Everything that CAN be done lives here as documentation.

# NAVIGATION TIPS
#
# Each skill subdirectory is like a floating book-sphere.
# Enter a skill: GO action-queue
# The skill's SKILL.md becomes your guide.
# The skill's README.md gives human context.
# The skill's templates show what to create.
#
# Skills have RELATIONSHIPS (see also sections).
# Follow these to discover related capabilities.
# The Nexus remembers what you've learned.

# THE LIVING LIBRARY
#
# This isn't a static collection. Skills:
# - Reference each other (see_also fields)
# - Share concepts (protocol symbols)
# - Build on each other (inheritance)
# - Conflict sometimes (mutually exclusive approaches)
#
# The coherence-engine skill keeps them harmonized.
# When skills contradict, consult it for resolution.
