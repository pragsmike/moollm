# ROOM.yml — The Skill Nexus
#
# This is a ROOM — a metaphysical library where all capabilities live.
# Every skill is a book that teaches itself when you read it.
# Every cluster is a shelf of related knowledge.
# Every ensemble is a team that works together.

    You stand in a vast spherical chamber. Books float in mid-air,
    orbiting a central point of warm light. But these aren't books —
    they're SKILLS. Living documents that teach themselves.
    
    Touch one and it opens. Read it and you GAIN the capability.
    But more than that — the skills RELATE to each other.
    
    Lines of golden light connect related skills. Tug on one and
    the connected ones drift closer. This isn't a library — it's
    a CONSTELLATION of knowledge.
    
    Some skills cluster in groups:
    - The SIMULATION cluster (time, buff, needs, economy)
    - The DELIBERATION cluster (debate, roberts-rules, rubric)
    - The NARRATIVE cluster (adventure, storytelling, hero-story)
    - The META cluster (skill, protocol, postel)
    
    Some skills are ENSEMBLES — teams that work together:
    - adversarial-committee + roberts-rules + evaluator
    - card + advertisement + data-flow
    - room + character + persona
    
    The central light pulses. It's the COHERENCE ENGINE —
    the thing that keeps all these skills in harmony.
    
  atmosphere:
    lighting: warm golden glow from center, cool blue from skill-books
    sound: whispers of documentation, rustling pages, distant debates
    feeling: infinite possibility, organized chaos, living knowledge

# THE ARCHITECTURE OF SKILLS
#
# Skills are CAPABILITIES — things the system can DO.
# They live here but are INSTANTIATED into adventures.
#
# A skill contains:
#   SKILL.md     — The executable documentation (LLM reads this)
#   README.md    — Human-friendly overview (GitHub readers)
#   *.yml.tmpl   — Templates that instantiate into state files
#
# When you USE a skill, you:
#   1. Read the SKILL.md to understand what to do
#   2. Instantiate templates into your adventure directory
#   3. The state files become YOUR state
#   4. The skill becomes YOUR capability

# NAVIGATION TIPS
#
# Each skill subdirectory is like a floating book-sphere.
# Enter a skill: GO action-queue
# The skill's SKILL.md becomes your guide.
# The skill's README.md gives human context.
# The skill's templates show what to create.
#
# Skills have RELATIONSHIPS (see also sections).
# Follow these to discover related capabilities.
# The Nexus remembers what you've learned.

# THE LIVING LIBRARY
#
# This isn't a static collection. Skills:
# - Reference each other (see_also fields)
# - Share concepts (protocol symbols)
# - Build on each other (inheritance)
# - Conflict sometimes (mutually exclusive approaches)
#
# The coherence-engine skill keeps them harmonized.
# When skills contradict, consult it for resolution.
