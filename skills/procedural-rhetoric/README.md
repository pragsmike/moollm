## Overview

Ian Bogost's concept: games and simulations persuade through **processes and rules**, not just words or visuals.

MOOLLM applies this to everything:
- YAML schemas define what's *thinkable*
- Advertisements define what's *possible*
- Constraints define what's *normative*
- Defaults define what's *assumed*
