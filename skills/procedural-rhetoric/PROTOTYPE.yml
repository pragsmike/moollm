# Procedural Rhetoric Skill
# Rules persuade. Structure IS argument.

skill:
  name: procedural-rhetoric
  purpose: "Design objects, rooms, and worlds with intentional ideological structures"
  
  # The triumvirate
  integrates:
    - PROCEDURAL-RHETORIC  # Ian Bogost — rules carry ideology
    - MASKING-EFFECT       # Scott McCloud — abstraction enables projection
    - SIMULATOR-EFFECT     # Will Wright — imagination fills gaps
    
  # When to invoke this skill
  invoke_when:
    - "Creating objects with values embedded"
    - "Designing world generation profiles"
    - "Writing advertisements for actions"
    - "Crafting character templates"
    - "Building inclusive/exclusive mechanics"
    
  # What it produces
  outputs:
    rhetoric_block: "Ideology, normalizes, enables, constrains, defaults"
    rhetorical_recipe: "Reusable pattern for rhetorical design"
    world_profile: "Generation guidelines with ideology"
    masked_character: "Abstract template for projection"
    sparse_description: "Evocative details that spark imagination"

# Rhetoric block structure (mixin for any object)
rhetoric_schema:
  ideology: "Core worldview this object embodies"
  normalizes: "List of behaviors/beliefs this makes normal"
  enables: "List of actions this makes possible"
  constrains: "List of actions this makes difficult/impossible"
  defaults: "What happens automatically (implicit values)"
  evokes: "Sparse sensory details for simulator effect"

  advertisements:

# Warning patterns (toxic rhetoric to avoid)
toxic_patterns:
  scarcity_as_default:
    pattern: "Everything contested"
    effect: "Teaches hoarding and distrust"
    
  zero_sum:
    pattern: "Your gain = my loss"
    effect: "Cooperation becomes irrational"
    
  violence_primary:
    pattern: "Combat is main verb"
    effect: "Other solutions invisible"
    
  stereotyped_roles:
    pattern: "NPCs locked to categories"
    effect: "Reinforces prejudice"

# Simulator effect guidelines
simulator_effect:
  # Less is more
  sparse_triggers_rich:
    do:
      - "Evocative sensory details"
      - "Questions without answers"
      - "Mysteries that invite speculation"
      - "Emotional resonance over factual completeness"
    avoid:
      - "Exhaustive inventories"
      - "Complete explanations"
      - "Exact measurements"
      - "Resolved mysteries"
      
  # Player imagination does heavy lifting
  let_them_fill:
    - "Character backgrounds"
    - "Unseen connections"
    - "Why things are the way they are"
    - "What happens off-screen"

# Masking effect guidelines  
masking_effect:
  abstraction_levels:
    high:
      details: "Minimal — almost archetypal"
      projection: "Maximum — anyone can be this"
      examples: "The Wanderer, The Child, The Wise One"
      
    medium:
      details: "Some specifics — recognizable type"
      projection: "Moderate — fits many but not all"
      examples: "A young merchant, An old soldier"
      
    low:
      details: "Specific individual"
      projection: "Limited — observing not being"
      examples: "Captain Ashford, Mother"
