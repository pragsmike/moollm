## Overview

Create a fixed roster of characters with opposing propensities to force genuine debate. Each persona surfaces different blind spots and challenges different assumptions.

## The Committee Pattern

| Character | Propensity | What They Surface |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Maya** | Paranoid realism | Political dynamics, hidden agendas |
| **Frankie** | Idealism | Value conflicts, missed opportunities |
| **Joe** | Continuity guardian | Institutional memory, precedent |
| **Vic** | Evidence prosecutor | Proof demands, data gaps |
| **Tammy** | Systems thinker | Feedback loops, unintended consequences |

## Why It Works

LLMs give statistically-likely answers that encode:
- Survivorship bias
- Genre conventions  
- Hidden assumptions

Adversarial debate performs **structured perturbation of the narrative space** — stories that survive cross-examination are more robust.
