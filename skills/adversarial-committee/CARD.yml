# Multiple personas with incompatible values debate to surface blind spots.
# "No single story is true — but the ensemble approximates actionable wisdom."

card:
  id: adversarial-committee
  name: "Adversarial Committee"

  description: |
    Form a committee of personas with opposing propensities.
    They debate using Robert's Rules, producing output that gets
    independently evaluated against a rubric.
    
    Play this card when facing complex decisions that require
    multiple perspectives to avoid blind spots.

# SELECTION STRATEGIES
# Used by FORM-SMART to select diverse committee members

selection-strategies:
  core:
    description: "Mike Gallaher's canonical 5-member pattern"
    size: 5
    composition:
      - propensity: paranoid_realism, role: devil's_advocate
      - propensity: idealism, role: opportunity_scout
      - propensity: continuity_guardian, role: historian
      - propensity: evidence_prosecutor, role: evidence_checker
      - propensity: systems_thinking, role: systems_analyst
    ensures: "Maximum diversity: 5 propensities, 3+ epistemologies, 5 roles"
    
  balanced:
    description: "Extended committee for deeper exploration"
    size: 6-7
    composition:
      - core pattern (5 members)
      - 1-2 additional: operational_realism or evidence_guardian
    ensures: "Core diversity plus operational/evaluation depth"
    
  consensus:
    description: "Optimized for reaching decisions efficiently"
    size: 5
    composition:
      - 1 pusher: low risk, devil's_advocate
      - 1 optimist: high risk, opportunity_scout
      - 2-3 synthesizers: medium risk, can bridge perspectives
    ensures: "Tension (pusher vs optimist) balanced with consensus-builders"
    
  evidence:
    description: "For decisions requiring rigorous proof"
    size: 6
    composition:
      - Multiple evidence-focused roles (prosecutor, guardian, architect)
      - 1 paranoid_realism for reality check
      - 1 systems_thinking for consequences
      - 1 continuity_guardian for precedent
    ensures: "Extensive evidence gathering and validation"
    
  innovation:
    description: "For exploring new opportunities"
    size: 6
    composition:
      - 2-3 optimists: high risk, opportunity_scout, innovation_scout
      - 1 paranoid_realism for reality check
      - 1 evidence_prosecutor for evidence check
      - 1 systems_thinking for consequences
    ensures: "Opportunity exploration with appropriate guardrails"

# INTEGRATION

workflow:
  typical-flow:
    - FORM or FORM-SMART committee with relevant personas
    - CONVENE session with topic
    - DELIBERATE following roberts-rules
    - VOTE on motion
    - EVALUATE output against rubric
    - If score poor, critique → DELIBERATE again
    - DISSOLVE when decision reached
    
  smart-selection-flow:
    - FORM-SMART with pool path and strategy
    - Review selection rationale
    - Adjust if needed (include/exclude specific members)
    - CONVENE session with topic
    - Continue as typical-flow
