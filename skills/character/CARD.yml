# CARD.yml — Character
#
# Core patterns for all characters — home, location, relationships.
# "Characters are BODIES. They have location, inventory, mortality."

card:
  id: character
  name: "Character"
  type: [skill, entity, game]
  
  emoji: 🧑
  
  rarity: common  # Every game needs characters
  
  description: |
    The foundational pattern for any entity that has a location,
    inventory, and relationships. Players, NPCs, creatures, bots —
    all are characters.
    
    Characters are BODIES (actors). Personas are COSTUMES (roles).
    The character is who you ARE. The persona is who you PLAY.

# HOME VS LOCATION DISTINCTION

location-protocol:
  home: "The directory path and file name where the CHARACTER.yml file lives. Never moves. Used by incoming references."
  location: "Where the character currently IS. Changes during play."
  movement: "Update location field, don't move files."
  example: |
    # File at: characters/bumblewick/CHARACTER.yml
    home: characters/bumblewick/
    location: pub/  # Currently at the pub

# STATE OWNERSHIP — CHARACTER.yml is CANONICAL

state-ownership:
  principle: "Characters own their own state. CHARACTER.yml is the source of truth."
  
  canonical_fields:
    - location      # Where the character is
    - inventory     # What they carry
    - gold          # Resources
    - sims_traits   # Personality (stable)
    - mind_mirror   # Thought planes
    - relationships # Who they know
    - memories      # What they remember
    
  mirror_pattern: |
    ADVENTURE.yml may mirror some state (e.g., player.location) for convenience,
    but CHARACTER.yml is always canonical. If conflict, CHARACTER.yml wins.
    
  update_protocol:
    1: "Edit CHARACTER.yml first (canonical)"
    2: "Optionally update ADVENTURE.yml mirror"
    3: "If conflict, CHARACTER.yml wins"

# CHARACTER TYPES

character-types:
  player: "Controlled by human via chat"
  npc: "Controlled by DM, responds when addressed"
  companion: "Follows player, has own personality"
  bot: "Autonomous via action queue"
  agent: "LLM with own goals and initiative"
  logistic-bot: "Factorio-style carrier that moves items between containers"

# LOGISTICS BOT BEHAVIOR (Factorio Inspired!)
#
# Characters can act as logistic bots — autonomous carriers
# that transport items between providers and requesters.
#
# FACTORIO MAPPING:
#   Logistic Bot → Character with behavior.type: logistic-bot
#   Roboport → Character's home base (charging, resting)
#   Cargo → Inventory slots designated for transport
#   Range → How far from roboport the bot will travel

logistics-behavior:
  description: |
    Characters with behavior.type: logistic-bot will:
    1. Find items in active-provider containers
    2. Pick them up into cargo slots
    3. Find matching requester containers
    4. Deliver items there
    5. Return to roboport when idle
    
  schema:
    behavior:
      type: logistic-bot
      roboport: "path/to/charging-station"    # Home base
      cargo_slots: 3                           # How much they can carry
      range: 5                                 # Max rooms from roboport
      speed: 1                                 # Rooms per turn
      priority: "nearest"                      # nearest | fullest | emptiest
      filters: []                              # Only carry matching items
    
  example: |
    character:
      id: delivery-kitten
      name: "Courier Kitten"
      emoji: "🐱📦"
      species: kitten
      
      behavior:
        type: logistic-bot
        roboport: pub/#charging-station
        cargo_slots: 3
        range: 5
        
      ai: |
        Each turn:
          If cargo is empty:
            Find nearest active-provider with items
            Travel there, pick up items
          If cargo has items:
            Find matching requester
            Travel there, deliver items
          If idle:
            Return to roboport
