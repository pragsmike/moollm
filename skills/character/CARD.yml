# CARD.yml — Character
#
# Core patterns for all characters — home, location, relationships.
# "Characters are BODIES. They have location, inventory, mortality."

  id: character
  name: "Character"
  type: [skill, entity, game]

  rarity: common  # Every game needs characters
  
  description: |
    The foundational pattern for any entity that has a location,
    inventory, and relationships. Players, NPCs, creatures, bots —
    all are characters.
    
    Characters are BODIES (actors). Personas are COSTUMES (roles).
    The character is who you ARE. The persona is who you PLAY.

# HOME VS LOCATION DISTINCTION

location-protocol:
  home: "The directory path and file name where the CHARACTER.yml file lives. Never moves. Used by incoming references."
  location: "Where the character currently IS. Changes during play."
  movement: "Update location field, don't move files."
  example: |
    # File at: characters/bumblewick/CHARACTER.yml
    home: characters/bumblewick/
    location: pub/  # Currently at the pub

# STATE OWNERSHIP — CHARACTER.yml is CANONICAL

state-ownership:
  principle: "Characters own their own state. CHARACTER.yml is the source of truth."
  
  canonical_fields:
    - location      # Where the character is
    - inventory     # What they carry
    - gold          # Resources
    - sims_traits   # Personality (stable)
    - mind_mirror   # Thought planes
    - relationships # Who they know
    - memories      # What they remember
    
  mirror_pattern: |
    ADVENTURE.yml may mirror some state (e.g., player.location) for convenience,
    but CHARACTER.yml is always canonical. If conflict, CHARACTER.yml wins.
    
  update_protocol:
    1: "Edit CHARACTER.yml first (canonical)"
    2: "Optionally update ADVENTURE.yml mirror"
    3: "If conflict, CHARACTER.yml wins"

# CHARACTER TYPES

  player: "Controlled by human via chat"
