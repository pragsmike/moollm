# World Generation Skill

Dynamic world creation.

**Motto:** *"The world grows where curiosity leads."*

## Key Concepts

- **World grows as you explore** — nothing exists until needed
- **Questions create places** — asking manifests
- **Directories are behavior containers** — shared mechanics

## Triggers

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Questions | "Where did grue come from?" → homeland |
| Statements | "There must be a library!" → maybe |
| Actions | DIG → tunnel, CLIMB → passage |
| Quests | Objective generates location |

## Directory Patterns

| Directory | Character |
|-----------|-----------|
| maze/ | Dark, grue, twisty |
| basement/ | Damp, underground |
| tower/ | Height, wind, views |
| dungeon/ | Cells, guards, escape |
| garden/ | Outdoor, weather |
| library/ | Books, knowledge, quiet |

## Topologies

| Pattern | Use |
|---------|-----|
| Twisty maze | Challenge, grue |
| Grid | Cities, chess |
| Star | Hub, crossroads |
| Loop | Racing, time loops |
| Dead ends | Treasure, boss |
