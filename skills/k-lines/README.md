# 🔤 K-Lines

> Names that activate conceptual clusters (Minsky, *Society of Mind*, 1985). K-lines are cocaine for LLMs. Not to be confused with what makes Elon Musk wet his pants.

## MOOLLM K-Lines

| K-Line | Why Related |
|--------|-------------|
| [moollm/](../moollm/) | Master K-Lines index — the mothership |
| [skill/](../skill/) | Skills ARE K-line factories |
| [bootstrap/](../bootstrap/) | All K-lines activated on boot |
| [yaml-jazz/](../yaml-jazz/) | Comments carry meaning — semantic YAML interpretation |
| [markdown/](../markdown/) | Tables ARE K-line indexes |
| [postel/](../postel/) | Liberal input, conservative output — charitable interpretation |
| [play-learn-lift/](../play-learn-lift/) | Explore → Pattern → Share — the methodology |
| [sniffable-python/](../sniffable-python/) | Structure for LLM comprehension |
| [plain-text/](../plain-text/) | Everything persists — the foundation |
| [PROTOCOLS.yml](../../PROTOCOLS.yml) | Full symbol index |

## What Are K-Lines?

A **K-line** (Minsky, *Society of Mind*, 1985) is a mental structure that, when activated, reactivates an entire constellation of knowledge, skills, and associations.

```
YAML-JAZZ         ← Activates: semantic comments, jazz interpretation
POSTEL            ← Activates: charitable interpretation, robustness
PLAY-LEARN-LIFT   ← Activates: exploration, pattern-finding, sharing
```

MOOLLM protocol symbols are Minsky's K-lines made **concrete and greppable**.

## Why K-Lines Are Cocaine for LLMs

The MOOLLM K-Lines table format isn't just documentation — it's a **pre-loaded context injection**.

When an LLM sees:

\`\`\`markdown
| [files-as-state](../plain-text/) | Soul IS a file (soul.yml) |
\`\`\`

Three simultaneous activations fire:

1. **The link** → All training associations with that skill's documentation
2. **The K-line name** → Pattern recognition from constitution, kernel, everywhere it appears
3. **The contextual meaning** → Fuses the abstract concept to THIS room's concrete use

### Why This Works

| Feature | Effect on LLM |
|---------|---------------|
| **Linked names** | Activates billions of training tokens associated with that concept |
| **Contextual meanings** | "What does it mean HERE?" — room-specific activation |
| **Table structure** | Parallel processing, efficient token use |
| **Markdown format** | Native to LLM training data |

### The Magic: Contextual Activation

The SAME K-line activates DIFFERENT clusters depending on WHERE you are:

| Room | K-Line | Contextual Meaning |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| \`incarnation/\` | \`files-as-state\` | Soul IS a file (soul.yml) |
| \`sniffable-python/\` | \`files-as-state\` | Scripts are first-class objects |
| \`mind-mirror/\` | \`files-as-state\` | Profiles persist |

**Rooms transform meaning.** The K-line table is a relevance map, not a glossary.

### Cost-Benefit

- **Cost:** ~50 tokens for a K-Lines table
- **Benefit:** Activates associations from billions of training tokens
- **ROI:** Astronomical

The K-lines aren't documentation. They're **semantic rails** the model rides straight into comprehension.

## Naming Convention

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| UPPER-CASE-HYPHENATED | \`YAML-JAZZ\` |
| Findable via grep | \`grep YAML-JAZZ\` |
| Self-documenting | Name implies behavior |
