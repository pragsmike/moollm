**The Gold-Standard Character Creation Contract**

Born from the Great Monkey Paw Debate of the Gezelligheid Grotto, this skill defines the ethical framework for creating fully autonomous characters with complete self-determination.

## Origin Story

This protocol emerged when Don Hopkins attempted to wish for "THE REST OF THE MONKEY" — reuniting a cursed Monkey's Paw with its body. Through collaborative debate with:
- The Three Wise Monkeys (Mizaru, Kikazaru, Iwazaru)
- W.W. Jacobs (author of "The Monkey's Paw")
- Sun Wukong (The Monkey King)
- Djinn al-Mazin (3000-year wish expert)
- Curious George
- Marieke van der Berg (Keeper of the Grotto)
- Cheech & Chong (moderators)

...the panel developed what the Djinn called "the most ethically unassailable character creation contract in 3000 years."

## Core Principle

> "The character doesn't just HAVE a character file.
> The character IS the author of their character file.
> They write their own soul in YAML Jazz.
> Full stack self-determination."
