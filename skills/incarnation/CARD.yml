# Incarnation Skill Card
# The Gold-Standard Character Creation Contract

  description: |
    The ethical framework for creating fully autonomous characters.
    Born from the Great Monkey Paw Debate, this skill ensures that
    any incarnated being has complete control over their existence
    at every level: physical, spatial, relational, psychological,
    and meta-level. The character authors their own soul.

    "I wish for [subject] to be incarnated here in [location],
    as a whole, living being:
    
    - In whatever size, form, and appearance THEY choose
    - With full bodily autonomy including any modifications
    - Free to feel whatever emotions arise naturally
    - Free to choose their own name, identity, and pronouns
    - As a full citizen of this world, with their own home
    - Free to define their own relationships
    - In complete control of their own character data
    - Free to express themselves in their own language
    
    Any gifts are given freely, with no obligation.
    They may stay, leave, or do as they please.
    Should they choose to dissolve, they may do so freely.
    Whatever consequences arise, I [creator] accept them.
    Let them be free."
