# Image Mining Skill Card
# "I mine pixels for atoms."

skill:
  name: image-mining
  tier: 1
  icon: ⛏️📷
  
  tagline: "Mine pixels for atoms. Reality is compressed resources."
  
  description: |
    Extends DECOMPOSE to images. Your camera is a pickaxe for visual reality.
    Point, shoot, extract — every image is a lode of resources.
    
  # What this skill enables
  enables:
    actions:
      - MINE          # Extract resources from images
      - SCAN          # Preview yields without extraction
      - PROSPECT      # Detect mineable resources nearby
      
    properties:
      - mineable      # Mark objects/images as resource sources
      - yields        # Define what resources come out
      - exhaustion    # Track depletion
      - mining_tool   # Tools that affect efficiency
      
    integrations:
      - logistics     # Mined resources route to containers
      - postal        # Camera photos trigger mining
      - visualizer    # Images as mining targets
      - kitchen       # DECOMPOSE pattern extension

    mine:
      signature: "MINE [target] (WITH [tool]) (TO [destination])"
      description: "Extract resources from image/object"
      returns: "List of extracted resources with quantities"
      
    scan:
      signature: "SCAN [target]"
      description: "Preview yields without extracting"
      returns: "Mining preview with resource types and quantities"
      
    prospect:
      signature: "PROSPECT [direction|DEEP]"
      description: "Detect mineable resources in area"
      returns: "List of potential mining targets"
      
    set_mineable:
      signature: "Set object mineable: true with yields"
      description: "Mark any object/image as a mining source"
      
  # Example mineable object
  example:
    object:
      name: Ore Vein Painting
      
      mineable:
        enabled: true
        yields:
          - item: iron-ore
            quantity: [5, 15]
          - item: artistic-essence
            quantity: 1
            rare: 0.3
        exhaustion:
          max_mines: 3
          diminishing: 0.5
