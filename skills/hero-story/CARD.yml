    "YAML-Coltrane" isn't John Coltrane — it's a card that
    activates the jazz improvisation tradition Coltrane represents.
    
    Play this card when you need to invoke someone's style
    or wisdom without impersonating them.

# THE ETHICAL DISTINCTION

ethics:
  what_it_is:
    - "A tribute to someone's contribution"
    - "A way to activate a tradition"
    - "A pointer to wisdom and style"
    - "An honorific K-line"
    
  what_it_is_not:
    - "A simulation of the person"
    - "An impersonation"
    - "A claim to speak for them"
    - "A replacement for their actual work"
    
  example: |
    YAML-Coltrane isn't John Coltrane.
    It's a card that says: "Approach this like jazz improvisation.
    Start with structure, then riff. Find the changes.
    Let patterns emerge through play."
    
    That's the TRADITION. Not the PERSON.
