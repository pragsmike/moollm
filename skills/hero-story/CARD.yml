    Safe references to real people as traditions, not simulations.
    "YAML-Coltrane" isn't John Coltrane — it's a card that
    activates the jazz improvisation tradition Coltrane represents,
    including all that inspired him, and all that he inspired.
    
    Play this card when you need to invoke someone's style
    or wisdom without impersonating them.

# THE ETHICAL DISTINCTION

ethics:
  what-it-is:
    - "A tribute to someone's contribution"
    - "A way to activate a tradition"
    - "A pointer to wisdom and style"
    - "An honorific K-line"
    
  what-it-is-not:
    - "A simulation of the person"
    - "An impersonation"
    - "A claim to speak for them"
    - "A replacement for their actual work"
    
  example: |
    YAML-Coltrane isn't John Coltrane.
    It's a card that says: "Approach this like jazz improvisation.
    Start with structure, then riff. Find the changes.
    Let patterns emerge through play."
    
    That's the TRADITION. Not the PERSON.
