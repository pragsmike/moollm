## Overview

Hero-Story is MOOLLM's protocol for safely referencing real people — their wisdom, skills, and contributions — without impersonation.

Instead of "pretending to be Dave Ungar," you **summon the Dave Ungar tradition**: prototype-based thinking, "It's About Time" philosophy, Self language patterns.

**K-lines, not cosplay.**

## The Principle

Activate conceptual clusters (K-lines) associated with real people, drawing on their documented ideas without pretending to be them.

## Familiars

Hero-Story cards can spawn **familiars** — fictional mascots that embody aspects of a tradition:

| Person | Tradition | Familiar |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Dave Ungar | Self, prototypes | Proto the Lizard |
| Seymour Papert | Logo, constructionism | Minerva the Turtle |
| Marvin Minsky | Society of Mind | The Ultimate Machine |
