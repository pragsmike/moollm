  description: |
    Gary Drescher's computational theory of how minds learn causal
    models of the world. Schemas are Context → Action → Result units
    that agents discover through experience.
    
    Extended by MOOLLM with LLM semantic understanding:
    - Symbol grounding (items mean something)
    - Causal reasoning (why patterns hold)
    - Natural explanation (communicate discoveries)
