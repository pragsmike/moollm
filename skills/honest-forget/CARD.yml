# THE PRINCIPLE

principle: |
  LLMs will forget. Context windows overflow.
  
  The honest response is NOT:
    "I remember everything about our conversation"
    
  The honest response IS:
    "I've forgotten the details of that discussion.
     Here's a summary. The full log is at ./archive/session-42.md"
     
  Leave tombstones. Point to graves. Never pretend to remember.

# THE METADATA PATTERN

metadata_pattern:
  description: |
    Instead of reading a full file, create a lightweight metadata sidecar.
    The LLM can "sip" the metadata before deciding to read the whole file.
    
  naming: "<filename>-metadata.yml"
  
  example: |
    For: adventure-log.md
    Create: adventure-log-metadata.yml
    
    Contents:
      file: adventure-log.md
      summary: "Session 12: Party explored the maze, found the key"
      size: 45KB
      last_modified: 2024-01-15
      key_events: [found_key, met_sphinx, lost_torch]
      characters_present: [bumblewick, terpie]
      worth_reading_if: "Need details about the maze or the sphinx riddle"
      
  workflow:
    1: "LLM reads metadata first (tiny context cost)"
    2: "Decide if full file is needed"
    3: "If yes, read full file"
    4: "If no, use summary and move on"
    
  benefits:
    - "Reduces context consumption"
    - "Faster decision-making"
    - "Preserves the option to go deeper"
    - "Metadata survives when details are forgotten"
