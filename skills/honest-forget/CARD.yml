# THE PRINCIPLE

principle: |
  LLMs will forget. Context windows overflow.
  
  The honest response is NOT:
    "I remember everything about our conversation"
    
  The honest response IS:
    "I've forgotten the details of that discussion.
     Here's a summary. The full log is at ./archive/session-42.md"
     
  Leave tombstones. Point to graves. Never pretend to remember.
