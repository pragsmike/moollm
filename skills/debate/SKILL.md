# Debate

> **"No single story is true — but the ensemble approximates actionable wisdom."**

Structured deliberation that forces genuine exploration through adversarial dialogue.

tags: [moollm]

## Why Debate?

Traditional LLM chat gives you **the statistical center** — the most likely answer averaged across all training data. This misses:

- Outlier perspectives that might matter most
- Hidden assumptions embedded in the "obvious" answer
- Genuine trade-offs between competing values
- The shape of the possibility space

**Debate fixes this** by simulating multiple perspectives that must defend their positions against cross-examination.

## Transcript Format

```markdown
# Debate: Should We Adopt Microservices?

**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Moderator:** Roberts-Rules-Bot
**Rounds:** 3

tags: [moollm]

## Opening Statements

### Pro (Maya)

> The question isn't whether microservices add complexity — they do.
> The question is whether our current monolith's hidden complexity
> is already killing us. Our deploy queue is 2 weeks. Our teams
> step on each other constantly. The pain is real and growing.

### Con (Vic)

> Show me the data. "Teams step on each other" — how often?
> What's the actual cost? I've seen microservice migrations
> that took 3 years and delivered negative value. The grass
> is always greener until you're debugging distributed traces
> at 3am.

### Pragmatic (Joe)

> What if we don't have to choose? A modular monolith gives us
> team boundaries without network calls. We can always extract
> services later when we have evidence they're needed.

## Round 1: Arguments

**Moderator:** Maya has the floor.

**Maya (Pro):** 
> I move that we consider deployment independence as the primary
> benefit. [MOTION]

**Tammy (Con):**
> Second, for purposes of debate. [SECOND]

**Moderator:** Motion seconded. Floor is open.

**Frankie (Pro):**
> ARGUMENT: Our current deploy process requires full regression
> because any change could affect any part of the system.
> With service boundaries, teams deploy independently.
> ```yaml
> evidence:
>   current_deploy_time: "2 weeks"
>   microservice_target: "< 1 day per service"
>   source: "internal metrics"
> ```

**Vic (Con):**
> REBUTTAL: You're trading deploy coordination for runtime
> coordination. Now every service call can fail. Your "1 day
> deploys" will be offset by distributed debugging.

## Verdict

**Audience Scores:**
| Audience | Leaning | Confidence |
|----------|---------|------------|
| architect-1 | pragmatic | 0.8 |
| ops-1 | con | 0.7 |
| dev-1 | pragmatic | 0.6 |

**Independent Evaluator:**
```yaml
evaluation:
  winner: pragmatic
  reasoning: |
    Pro made strong organizational arguments but didn't
    address operational complexity sufficiently.
    Con's evidence demands were valid but position
    was purely defensive.
    Pragmatic offered concrete middle path with
    lower risk and clear upgrade path.
  confidence: 0.7
  dissenting_view: "Pro's velocity argument deserves more weight"
```

**Final Verdict:** Modular monolith (pragmatic position)
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### With adversarial-committee

Debate IS an adversarial committee in action. The sides are the committee members with opposing propensities.

### With roberts-rules

The moderator can enforce full parliamentary procedure:

```yaml
moderator:
  style: roberts_rules
  enforces:
    - motions_require_second
    - debate_before_vote
    - point_of_order_interrupts
    - two_thirds_for_closure
```

### With rubric

Audience and evaluator can use explicit rubrics:

```yaml
rubric:
  criteria:
    - name: evidence_quality
      weight: 0.3
      levels: [anecdotal, case_study, systematic]
      
    - name: addresses_counterarguments
      weight: 0.25
      levels: [ignores, acknowledges, refutes]
      
    - name: practical_feasibility
      weight: 0.25
      levels: [theoretical, plausible, demonstrated]
      
    - name: risk_assessment
      weight: 0.2
      levels: [ignores, mentions, quantifies]
```

### With speed-of-light

The entire debate can happen in ONE LLM call:

```yaml
# One epoch simulates multiple rounds of debate
speed_of_light:
  characters: 5  # Maya, Frankie, Vic, Tammy, Joe
  rounds: 3
  arguments_per_round: 6
  total_simulated: 18 exchanges
  llm_calls: 1
```
