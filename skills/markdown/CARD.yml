# Anil Dash's 10 Reasons
ten_reasons_markdown_won:
  - Great brand
  - Solved a real problem
  - Built on existing behaviors
  - Community ready to help
  - Right flavor for every context
  - Released at time of behavior change
  - Came at cusp of build tool era
  - Works with "view source"
  - Not encumbered by IP

# GFM extensions
github_flavored_extensions:
  - Tables
  - Task lists
  - Fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting
  - Collapsible sections (details/summary) — CRITICAL for long docs!
  - Alerts (NOTE, WARNING, etc.)
  - Mermaid diagrams — flowcharts, sequences, state machines, ERDs

# Collapsible sections best practice
collapsible_pattern:
  insight: "The <summary> tag should tell readers what's inside WITHOUT opening"
  bad: "<summary>Click to see more</summary>"
  good: "<summary><strong>🎤 Gary's Talk — Schema + LLM = Flight</strong></summary>"
  use_cases:
    - "Session logs with expandable sections"
    - "Technical docs with optional depth"
    - "Long narratives with scannable structure"

# Mermaid diagram types
mermaid_diagrams:
  - type: "flowchart"
    use: "Process flow, decision trees"
  - type: "sequenceDiagram"
    use: "Interactions between components"
  - type: "stateDiagram-v2"
    use: "State machines, room transitions"
  - type: "erDiagram"
    use: "Data models, relationships"
