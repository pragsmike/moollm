## Skill Tiers

| Tier | Tools Required | Examples |
|------|----------------|----------|
| 0 | None (pure prompt) | Writing styles, reasoning patterns |
| 1 | File read/write | Most skills |
| 2 | + Terminal | Debugging, code-review |

**Principle:** Use the lowest tier possible.

## Skill Anatomy (New Structure)

```
skills/
  my-skill/
    README.md         # Human entry point (GitHub renders this)
    SKILL.md          # Full spec with YAML frontmatter
    *.tmpl            # Templates at root level
```

Every skill has:
- `README.md` — Quick overview, links
- `SKILL.md` — Full protocol with YAML frontmatter defining `name`, `tier`, `allowed-tools`

---

## Quick Start

### Use a Skill

1. Read the skill's `README.md`
2. Read `SKILL.md` for full protocol
3. Copy `*.tmpl` files to your working directory
4. Follow the documented protocol

### Create a New Skill

1. Create `skills/my-skill/` directory
2. Copy templates from `skills/skill/`:
   - `README.md.tmpl` → `README.md`
   - `SKILL.md.tmpl` → `SKILL.md`
   - `SKILL.yml.tmpl` → for instances
3. Fill in template variables
4. Add `CARD.yml` if the skill is playable
5. Register in `INDEX.yml`

Or just tell the LLM: "Create a new skill called 'my-skill' using the skill skill."

---

## Meta Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [INDEX.yml](./INDEX.yml) | Machine-readable skill registry |
| [ROOM.yml](./ROOM.yml) | The Skill Nexus — this directory as a metaphysical room |
| [skill/](./skill/) | The meta-skill with templates and protocols |
| [skill/delegation-object-protocol.md](./skill/delegation-object-protocol.md) | Self-like inheritance (Ungar) |
| [skill/skill-instantiation-protocol.md](./skill/skill-instantiation-protocol.md) | How skills become instances |
