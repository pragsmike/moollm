# MOOLLM Skills

> *"Skills are conventions the model follows, not code the orchestrator runs."*

Userland protocols over files.

> [!TIP]
> **New here?** Start with [constructionism/](./constructionism/) — the philosophy. Then [skill/](./skill/) — the meta-skill explaining how skills work. Then explore [room/](./room/) — it has everything!

## Seven Architectural Improvements

MOOLLM extends [Anthropic's skill model](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-library) with seven innovations:

| # | Extension | What It Adds | Proof |
|---|-----------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | **Instantiation** | Skills as prototypes creating instances. Not just prompts — living programs. | [`adventure/`](./adventure/) → [`adventure-4/`](../examples/adventure-4/) with 150+ files |
| 2 | **Three-Tier Persistence** | Platform (ephemeral) → Narrative (append) → State (edit). | [6000+ line session logs](../examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/marathon-session.md), persistent room state |
| 3 | **K-lines** | Names as semantic activation vectors (Minsky). | "[Palm](../examples/adventure-4/characters/animals/palm/)" activates entire soul, history, relationships |
| 4 | **Empathic Templates** | Smart generation, not string substitution. | [Biscuit's](../examples/adventure-4/characters/animals/biscuit/) description generated from traits |
| 5 | **Speed of Light** | Many turns in one call, minimal tokenization. | [33-turn Fluxx](../examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/marathon-session.md), [21-turn cat prowl](../examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/marathon-session.md) |
| 6 | **CARD.yml** | Machine-readable interface with advertisements. | Every skill exposes methods, tools, state schema — see [card/](./card/) |
| 7 | **Ethical Framing** | Room-based inheritance of performance context. | [`pub/stage/`](../examples/adventure-4/pub/stage/) inherits `framing: performance` |

**The key insight:** Skills aren't documentation. They're programs. The LLM is `eval()`.

## Skill Tiers

| Tier | Tools Required | Examples |
|------|----------------|----------|
| 0 | None (pure prompt) | Writing styles, reasoning patterns |
| 1 | File read/write | Most skills |
| 2 | + Terminal | Debugging, code-review |

**Principle:** Use the lowest tier possible.

---

## Skill Anatomy (Required Structure)

```
skills/
  my-skill/
    README.md         # Human entry point (GitHub renders this)
    SKILL.md          # Full spec with YAML frontmatter
    CARD.yml          # Machine-readable interface definition
    *.tmpl            # Optional: templates at root level
```

Every skill has **three required files**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Quick overview, links (GitHub renders this) |
| `SKILL.md` | Full protocol with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `tier`, `allowed-tools`) |
| `CARD.yml` | Interface definition: methods, tools, state, advertisements |

---

## Quick Start

### Use a Skill

1. Read the skill's `README.md`
2. Read `SKILL.md` for full protocol
3. Copy `*.tmpl` files to your working directory
4. Follow the documented protocol

### Create a New Skill

1. Create `skills/my-skill/` directory
2. Copy templates from `skills/skill/`:
   - `README.md.tmpl` → `README.md`
   - `SKILL.md.tmpl` → `SKILL.md`
3. Create `CARD.yml` with methods, tools, state
4. Fill in template variables
5. Register in `INDEX.yml`

Or just tell the LLM: "Create a new skill called 'my-skill' using the skill skill."

---

## Meta Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [INDEX.yml](./INDEX.yml) | Machine-readable skill registry |
| [ROOM.yml](./ROOM.yml) | The Skill Nexus — this directory as a metaphysical room |
| [skill/](./skill/) | The meta-skill with templates and protocols |

---

## 🚪 The Skill Nexus as Shared Space

This `skills/` directory is a **shared room** accessible from any adventure. Unlike adventure-specific rooms, it lives at the repo root and connects to ALL adventures.

### Path Variables

Instead of counting `../../../` levels, use **path variables** that resolve at runtime. See [kernel/NAMING.yml](../kernel/NAMING.yml) for the full specification.

| Variable | Resolves To | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `$REPO/` | `moollm/` | Repository root |
| `$SKILLS/` | `moollm/skills/` | This directory |
| `$KERNEL/` | `moollm/kernel/` | Core protocols |
| `$ADVENTURE/` | Current adventure | From startup.yml |
| `$CHARACTERS/` | `$ADVENTURE/characters/` | Character alcoves |
| `$PERSONAS/` | `$ADVENTURE/personas/` | Mask wardrobe |
| `$PUB/` | `$ADVENTURE/pub/` | The gathering place |
| `$COATROOM/` | `$ADVENTURE/coatroom/` | Transformation room |
| `$START/` | `$ADVENTURE/start/` | Origin point |

### Example Usage

```yaml
# In skills/ROOM.yml — back-links to adventure
exits:
  coatroom:
    destination: $COATROOM/
    
relationships:
  maurice:
    location: $COATROOM/mannequin.yml
    
# In adventure YAML — forward-links to skills
exits:
  east:
    destination: $SKILLS/
```

### Concrete Resolution (when adventure-4 is active)

| Path Variable | Resolves To |
|---------------|-------------|
| `$COATROOM/mirror.yml` | `examples/adventure-4/coatroom/mirror.yml` |
| `$CHARACTERS/animals/palm/` | `examples/adventure-4/characters/animals/palm/` |
| `$SKILLS/character/` | `skills/character/` |

---

## Navigation

| Direction | Destination |
|-----------|-------------|
| ⬆️ Up | [Project Root](../) |
| ➡️ Sibling | [kernel/](../kernel/) — Low-level protocols |
| ➡️ Sibling | [schemas/](../schemas/) — Data formats |
| ➡️ Sibling | [designs/](../designs/) — Historical archives |
