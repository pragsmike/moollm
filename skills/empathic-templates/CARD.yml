  description: |
    Templates that leverage LLM comprehension for semantic instantiation.
    Not just string substitution — intelligent content generation that
    understands context and creates appropriate, coherent output.

tools:
  required: [read_file, write_file]
  optional: []
tier: 1

methods:
  INSTANTIATE:
    description: "Create instance from template with context"
    parameters:
      template: "Path to .tmpl file"
      context: "Variables and semantic hints"
      output_path: "Where to write result"
    output: "Populated instance file"
    
  PARSE:
    description: "Analyze template structure"
    parameters:
      template: "Template content or path"
    output: "Required and optional variables, slots"
    
  PREVIEW:
    description: "Show what instantiation would produce"
    parameters:
      template: "Template content"
      context: "Sample context"
    output: "Preview of generated content"
    
  VALIDATE:
    description: "Check if context satisfies template"
    parameters:
      template: "Template to check"
      context: "Proposed context"
    output: "Missing/optional variables, warnings"

state:
  current-template: "Active template being worked on"
  context: "Current instantiation context"
  partials: "Available partial templates"

template-syntax:
  basic:
    variable: "{{variable}}"
    expression: "{{expression}}"
    conditional: "{{#if condition}}...{{/if}}"
    iteration: "{{#each items}}...{{/each}}"
    partial: "{{> partial_name}}"

    infer: "{{infer_traits_from_context}}"
    
  expressions:
    uses: "empathic-expressions skill"
    supports: "code-switching, fuzzy conditions"

front-matter-pattern:
  purpose: "Let LLM sniff first 50 lines"
  includes:
    - Template name and purpose
    - Required variables with types
    - Optional variables with defaults
    - Example context

relationship-to-inheritance:
  templates: "Are prototypes (define shape)"
  instances: "Created by instantiation"
  inheritance: "Self-style delegation"
  empathy: "LLM adds semantic value"

anti-patterns:
  dumb-passthrough:
    bad: "description: '{{description}}'"
    good: "description: '{{describe_based_on_context}}'"
  no-context:
    bad: "Instantiate without semantic hints"
    good: "Provide tone, setting, constraints"
  over-specification:
    bad: "Template has 50 required variables"
    good: "Few required, many inferrable"
