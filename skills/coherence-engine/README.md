## Overview

Not just a chatbot. Not just a code generator. A **coherence engine** that:

- **Simulates** characters, rooms, objects — all at once
- **Roleplays** each entity faithfully
- **Acts** as each character would
- **Enables** speed-of-light telepathy between entities
- **Maintains** consistency across distributed state

## The Coherence Loop

```
1. READ relevant files into context
2. REASON about state, goals, constraints
3. SIMULATE interactions
4. DETECT inconsistencies
5. PROPOSE changes
6. WRITE updates to files
7. LOG what happened
```

## Core Responsibilities

- Simulation (characters, rooms, objects)
- Dependency tracking (ripple effects)
- Consistency checking (rules and schemas)
- Orchestration (multi-agent conversations)
