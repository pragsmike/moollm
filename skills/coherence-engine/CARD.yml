    The LLM's role as a consistency maintainer: simulating entities,
    tracking dependencies, detecting inconsistencies, and writing
    updates to files.
    
    Not a separate system — it's how the LLM naturally operates
    on the MOOLLM filesystem.

# TOOLS REQUIRED

tools:
  required: []  # Knowledge about how LLM maintains coherence
  optional:
    - read_file
    - write_file

tier: 0  # Primarily knowledge

# METHODS

methods:
  
  SIMULATE:
    description: "Advance simulation state for an entity"
    parameters:
      entity: "Character, room, or object"
      turns: "How many simulation turns"
    output: chat (narration) + state-changes
    effect: "Update entity state, tick buffs, process needs"
    invoked-by: [time, player, adventure]
    
  DETECT:
    description: "Find inconsistencies in world state"
    parameters:
      scope: "Area to check (room, character, or 'all')"
    output: chat (list of issues)
    effect: "Report contradictions, missing fields, broken refs"
    invoked-by: [self-repair, player]
    
  RECONCILE:
    description: "Fix detected inconsistencies"
    parameters:
      issues: "List of issues to fix"
      strategy: "How to resolve (auto, ask, conservative)"
    output: chat + state-changes
    effect: "Update files to restore consistency"
    invoked-by: [self-repair, player]
    
  ORCHESTRATE:
    description: "Coordinate multiple entity updates"
    parameters:
      entities: "List of entities to update"
      event: "What triggered the update"
    output: state-changes
    effect: "Update all entities consistently"
    invoked-by: [simulation, time]

# STATE
# Coherence engine doesn't have its own state — it operates on world state

state:
  # No persistent state
  # The engine maintains coherence of OTHER entities

# WHAT COHERENCE MEANS

coherence-domains:
  location-consistency: "Character.location matches room occupants"
  inventory-consistency: "Object.location matches holder's inventory"
  relationship-bidirectional: "If A knows B, does B know A?"
  buff-expiration: "Buffs with duration 0 are removed"
  reference-validity: "All paths resolve to actual files"

# THE BIG INSIGHT

insight: |
  The LLM doesn't run algorithms. It reads state, notices
  inconsistencies, and writes fixes. This IS the coherence engine.
  
  When the LLM says "I'll update the player's location and
  add them to the room's occupants list" — that's coherence
  maintenance in action.
  
  No separate orchestrator needed. The LLM is the orchestrator.
