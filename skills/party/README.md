## Overview

Party management for companions, groups, and ensemble play. Companions have relationships with you AND each other. Asking about family/pets CREATES them!

## Simulation State

In `SIMULATION.yml`:

```yaml
party:
  members:
    - characters/don-hopkins/
    - pub/cat-cave/terpie.yml
  leader: characters/don-hopkins/
  formation: line

selection:
  targets: [pub/cat-cave/terpie.yml]  # Always a list
```

**Selection targets:** Characters, rooms (rooms are characters too!), objects, concepts.

## Commands

- `SELECT [target]` / `DESELECT`
- `PARTY` / `RECRUIT` / `DISMISS`
- `PARTY FORMATION [line/circle/defensive]`
- `HOLD / FOLLOW / SCATTER / REGROUP`

## Emergent Creation

Asking about family or companions **creates them**!
