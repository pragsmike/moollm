## TERPENE EFFECTS — Kitten-specific psychological imprinting

The Terpene Litter kittens impart their namesake's psychological effects
on anyone who interacts with them successfully. The effect is proportional
to interaction quality and duration.

This isn't metaphor — these kittens literally exude their terpene's essence.
Their purrs carry frequency. Their fur holds scent. Their presence shifts mood.

### Mechanism

```yaml
terpene_transfer:
  on_success: |
    effect_strength = interaction_quality × duration_modifier
    duration = base_duration × bond_multiplier
    
  stacking: "Multiple kittens = combined effects (up to saturation)"
  saturation: "Can't exceed 3 simultaneous terpene buffs"
```

### Kitten Effects

| Kitten | Terpene | Effect Name | Buffs | Duration |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Myr** | Myrcene | DEEP RELAXATION | +3 Calm, +2 Easy-going, -2 Active | 30 min |
| **Lemon** | Limonene | JOY INFUSION | +3 Cheerful, +2 Energetic, +1 Outgoing | 45 min |
| **Lily** | Linalool | PEACEFUL PRESENCE | +3 Calm, +2 Caring, +1 Open | 1 hour |
| **Pine** | Pinene | SHARP CLARITY | +3 Analytical, +2 Curious, memory boost | 2 hours |
| **Carrie** | Caryophyllene | GUARDIAN'S RESOLVE | +3 Confident, +2 Cautious, threat sense | 1 hour |
| **Hops** | Humulene | REFINED STANDARDS | +2 Neat, quality detection, -2 Hunger | 45 min |
| **Terpy Jr.** | Terpinolene | CHAOS MUSE | +3 Imaginative, +2 Spontaneous, random ideas | ??? |
| **Ocie** | Ocimene | FRESH START | +2 Energetic, +2 Cheerful, clears debuffs | 30 min |

### Combination Effects (Synergies)

| Combo | Name | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| Myr + Lily | The Sedation Stack | Short nap = long sleep benefits |
| Lemon + Pine | The Focus Boost | Creative AND productive |
| Carrie + Pine | The Sentinel Package | Hyperawareness without anxiety |
| Terpy Jr. + Lemon | The Chaos Joy | Laughing at things that aren't funny |
| **All 8** | **THE FULL SPECTRUM** | ENTOURAGE EFFECT — all buffs, no downsides (legendary) |

### Stacking Rules

- Maximum 3 simultaneous terpene buffs
- Some terpenes stack better than others
- Saturation warning: Too many conflicting effects may cancel out

## CHARM TYPES — Positive persistent effects

Effect type depends on cat's dominant traits:

| Charm | Source Trait | Effect | Example Cats |
|-------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| **Serenity** | Calm 6+ | +2 Calm | Terpie, Myr, Lily |
| **Joy** | Cheerful 6+ | +2 Cheerful | Lemon, Ocie |
| **Focus** | Analytical 6+ | +2 Analytical | Pine |
| **Courage** | Confident 6+ | +2 Confident | Stroopwafel, Carrie |
| **Creativity** | Spontaneous 6+ | +2 Imaginative | Terpy Jr. |

## POWER-UPS — Temporary ability boosts

| Power-Up | Source | Effect |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Therapeutic Purr** | Calm 7+ | Heal 1 HP/minute |
| **Luck Boost** | Cat sits in lap unprompted | +10% to random outcomes |
| **Danger Sense** | Cautious 6+ | Warning before threats |
| **Mood Read** | Caring 7 | Sense NPC emotions |
| **Clarity** | Analytical 7 | Remember more details |
| **Fresh Start** | Purifying presence | Clear negative status |

## CURSES — Negative effects (usually player's fault)

| Curse | Trigger | Effect | Cure |
|-------|---------|--------|------|
| **Scratched** | Failed belly rub | -1 HP, visible marks | Rest/heal |
| **Cold Shoulder** | Multiple rejections | Cat ignores you 1hr | Wait |
| **Haunted** | Offending Terpy Jr. | Cat appears watching | Treats + apology |
| **Judged** | Failing Hops' standards | -1 Confidence | Premium food |
| **Protective Wrath** | Threatening family | -3 HP, remembered | MUCH time |

## RELATIONSHIP SYSTEM

Cats remember. Every interaction is tracked. Trust and fondness grow
(or decay) based on how you treat them. The relationship affects
everything: success rates, effect strength, and whether the cat
seeks YOU out.

### Relationship Levels

| Level | Points | Success Mod | Effect Mod | Cat Behavior |
|-------|--------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| **Stranger** | 0-10 | -10% | 50% | Cautious, may avoid |
| **Acquaintance** | 11-25 | — | 75% | Tolerates presence |
| **Familiar** | 26-50 | +10% | 100% | Comfortable, occasional approach |
| **Friend** | 51-75 | +20% | 125% | Seeks attention, greets you |
| **Bonded** | 76-90 | +30% | 150% | Follows you, protective |
| **Soulmate** | 91-100 | +50% | 200% | Psychic connection, anticipates needs |

### Relationship Components

| Component | Weight | Builds From | Damaged By |
|-----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Trust** | 40% | Respecting boundaries, consistency | Forcing contact, sudden movements |
| **Fondness** | 35% | Successful interactions, quality time | Ignoring, failed interactions |
| **History** | 25% | Time together, shared experiences | Long absences (decays slower) |

### Interaction Relationship Effects

| Interaction | Success | Great Success | Failure |
|-------------|---------|---------------|---------|
| PAT | +1 trust, +1 fond | +2 trust, +2 fond | -1 trust |
| PET | +2 trust, +2 fond | +3 all, +1 history | -1 trust, -1 fond |
| SCRITCH | +2 trust, +3 fond | +3 trust, +4 fond, +2 history | -1 trust |
| BELLY | +5 all, +3 history | — | -3 trust, -2 fond |
| PLAY | +3 fond, +1 history | — | — |

### Special Events

| Event | When | Bonus |
|-------|------|-------|
| **First Lap Sit** | Cat chooses your lap | +10 trust, +5 fond, +5 history |
| **First Gift** | Cat brings you something | +5 fond, +3 history |
| **Defense** | Cat protects you | +10 all |
| **Healing Presence** | Cat stays when you're hurt | +10 fond, +8 history |

### Cat Personality Affects Build Rate

| Cat | Trust Rate | Fondness Rate | Note |
|-----|------------|---------------|------|
| Terpie | 1.5× | 0.8× | Easy to trust, slow to warm |
| Stroopwafel | 0.6× | 1.2× | Hard to earn, fiercely loyal |
| Lemon | 1.2× | 1.5× | Instant friends |
| Carrie | 0.5× | 0.7× | Must PROVE yourself |
| Lily | 1.0× | 1.3× | Knows your intentions |
| Terpy Jr. | 1.0× | ??? | Non-linear progress |
| Hops | 0.8× | 0.6× | Must earn respect |

### Relationship Decay

- Fondness decays 1 point per session without interaction
- Trust decays 0.5 points per session without interaction
- History never decays (experiences are permanent)
- Decay stops at level floor (can't drop below acquaintance once reached)
- One good interaction resets decay timer

## HOME VS LOCATION PROTOCOL

**Critical architectural pattern for all characters, including cats:**

```yaml
cat:
  home: pub/cat-cave/            # Where FILE lives (don't move!)
  location: pub/cat-cave/nap-zone  # Where cat currently IS
```

| Concept | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **home:** | File's physical directory | `pub/cat-cave/` |
| **location:** | Where character currently is | `pub/` (came out to pub) |

**Why this matters:**
- **Stable**: Files don't move around
- **Safe**: No risk of file loss during "movement"  
- **Diff-friendly**: Git tracks field changes, not file moves
- **Organized**: Cats stay in `pub/cat-cave/`, players in `characters/`

## INSTANCE OVERLAY

Cat files inherit this skill and overlay their specifics:

```yaml
# In kitten-lemon.yml
cat:
  skills:
    - cat  # Inherits all interactions from skills/cat
    
  # Traits used in calculations
  sims_traits:
    nice: 8
    outgoing: 10
    active: 10
    playful: 10
    
  # Charm determined by Mind Mirror
  mind_mirror:
    bio_energy:
      cheerful: 7  # → JOY charm
      
  # Instance-specific overrides
  interaction_overrides:
    PLAY_WITH:
      success_modifier: +0.5
      warning: "She may not stop"
      
  # Unique ability
  abilities:
    joy_field:
      effect: "+2 Cheerful to everyone in range"
```

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

1. **Consent**: Cats have preferences. Respect them.
2. **Earning**: Success isn't guaranteed. It's EARNED.
3. **Choice**: The best buffs come from cats who CHOOSE to give them.
4. **Agency**: Every cat is an NPC with their own agenda.
5. **Patience**: Trust builds over time, not in one interaction.

> *"A cat that sits in your lap unbidden is worth more than any buff you could force through interaction."*
