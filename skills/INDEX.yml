# GUIDELINES

guidelines:
  structure:
    - "Every skill needs README.md (landing page), SKILL.md (full spec), and CARD.yml (interface)"
    - "README.md: Human-friendly overview, when to use, quick start"
    - "SKILL.md: Full specification with YAML frontmatter"
    - "CARD.yml: Machine-readable interface — methods, tools, state, advertisements"
    - "Templates live at skill root level (not in template/ subdirectory)"
    - "Templates use .tmpl extension for files with variable substitution"
    
  tiers:
    tier_0: "Knowledge only: no tools required"
    tier_1: "File-only: read_file, write_file, list_dir"
    tier_2: "Read + Execute: + run_terminal_cmd, grep"
    
  naming:
    - "Skill directories: lowercase-with-dashes"
    - "Core files: UPPERCASE.ext (README.md, SKILL.md, CARD.yml)"
    - "Templates: FILENAME.ext.tmpl at skill root"
    - "Methods in CARD.yml: LIKE-THIS (kebab-case, not LIKE_THIS)"
    
  registration:
    - "Register here when skill is ready for use"
    - "Use 'planned' section for skills in development"
