# GUIDELINES

guidelines:
  structure:
    - "Every skill needs SKILL.md (description) and PROTOTYPE.yml (definition)"
    - "Use template/ subdirectory for files to copy on instantiation"
    - "Templates use .tmpl extension for files with variable substitution"
    
  tiers:
    tier_1: "File-only: read, write, navigate — no execution"
    tier_2: "Read + Execute: can run commands, tests, linters"
    tier_3: "Full access: network, git write, external APIs"
    
  naming:
    - "Skill directories: lowercase-with-dashes"
    - "Core files: UPPERCASE.ext (SKILL.md, PROTOTYPE.yml)"
    - "Templates: filename.ext.tmpl"
    
  registration:
    - "Register here when skill is ready for use"
    - "Use 'planned' section for skills in development"
