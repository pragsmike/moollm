# GUIDELINES

guidelines:
  structure:
    - "Every skill needs README.md (landing page) and SKILL.md (full spec with YAML frontmatter)"
    - "Templates live at skill root level (not in template/ subdirectory)"
    - "Templates use .tmpl extension for files with variable substitution"
    
  tiers:
    tier_0: "Knowledge only: no tools required"
    tier_1: "File-only: read_file, write_file, list_dir"
    tier_2: "Read + Execute: + run_terminal_cmd, grep"
    
  naming:
    - "Skill directories: lowercase-with-dashes"
    - "Core files: UPPERCASE.ext (README.md, SKILL.md)"
    - "Templates: FILENAME.ext.tmpl at skill root"
    
  registration:
    - "Register here when skill is ready for use"
    - "Use 'planned' section for skills in development"
