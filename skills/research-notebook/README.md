# Research Notebook

> **Structured research with sources, findings, and decisions.**

Track investigations and capture knowledge.

> [!TIP]
> **LEARN stage of [play-learn-lift](../play-learn-lift/).** Where patterns emerge from exploration.

## Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Questions** | What you're trying to learn |
| **Sources** | Where you looked |
| **Findings** | What you discovered |
| **Decisions** | What you concluded |

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) | Full protocol documentation |
| [PROTOTYPE.yml](./PROTOTYPE.yml) | Machine-readable definition |
| [template/](./template/) | Notebook and source templates |

## Example

```yaml
research:
  topic: "LLM context management strategies"
  
  questions:
    - "How do other systems handle token budgets?"
    - "What summarization approaches exist?"
    
  sources:
    - url: "paper-on-context.pdf"
      relevance: "Direct answer to Q1"
      
  findings:
    - "Sliding window is most common"
    - "Hierarchical summaries preserve more"
    
  decisions:
    - "Use tiered hot/cold approach"
```

## The Intertwingularity

Research-notebook is the LEARN stage of [play-learn-lift](../play-learn-lift/) — find patterns.
