    MOOLLM's approach to multi-agent simulation: many turns
    simulated within a single LLM call. Characters debate,
    vote, and decide without waiting for API round-trips.

  External multi-agent systems:
    Agent A → API call → wait → Agent B → API call → wait → ...
    
  MOOLLM speed-of-light:
    Single LLM call simulates A, B, C debating, voting, deciding.
    
  Why it works:
  - The LLM holds all personas in context
  - No network latency between "agents"
  - Coherence maintained by single model
  - Instant telepathy between simulated entities
