    MOOLLM's approach to multi-agent simulation: many turns
    simulated within a single LLM call. Characters debate,
    vote, and decide without waiting for API round-trips.

  External multi-agent systems:
    Agent A → API call → wait → Agent B → API call → wait → ...
    
  MOOLLM speed-of-light:
    Single LLM call simulates A, B, C debating, voting, deciding.
    
  Why it works:
  - The LLM holds all personas in context
  - No network latency between "agents"
  - Coherence maintained by single model
  - Instant telepathy between simulated entities

  INSIDE the LLM: high-dimensional vectors, precise, instant.
  AT THE BOUNDARY: serial tokens, lossy, glacial.
  
  Tokenization: Destroys precision, introduces noise.
  Detokenization: ANOTHER layer of noise and guessing.
  Round-trip: precision → noise → more noise → approximation
  
  The principle:
    Work with vectors at speed of light.
    Delay tokenization until last possible moment.
    
  Analogies:
    - Emacs screen update: defer and coalesce redraws
    - File batching: write once when stable
    - Vector-first: think in native dimensions

  Anti-pattern: "Carrier Pigeon Protocol"
    - Writing on toilet paper with crayon
    - Sending messages by carrier pigeon
    - When you could navigate idea-space at speed of light
