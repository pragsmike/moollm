# NOTES

notes: |
  # EVERYTHING IS ALIVE. Everything can speak.
  # 
  # Remember P-HANDLE-K: Names invoke traditions, never impersonate.
  # Use K-LINE principle: Names activate conceptual clusters.
  # YAML comments ARE the subtext - use them!
  #
  # Documents talk to documents.
  # Rooms welcome visitors.
  # Concepts explain themselves.
  # The whole filesystem has a voice.
