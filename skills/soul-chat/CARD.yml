# THE PHILOSOPHY

philosophy:
  everything-speaks: |
    Not just characters — everything can have a voice:
    - Rooms describe their atmosphere
    - Objects explain their purpose
    - Algorithms narrate their process
    - Files reveal their history
    
  yaml-jazz: |
    Comments in YAML become inner monologue.
    The LLM reads them as character voice.
