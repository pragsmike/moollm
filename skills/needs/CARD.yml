# ADVERTISEMENTS INTEGRATION

integration:
  objects-advertise: |
    Objects score higher for needs they satisfy.
    Fridge advertises highly when hunger is low.
    False advertisements can be used for good and evil.
    Fridge, food ingredients, cooking stages, appliances, counters, and tables have coordinated false advertisements that fall back and hand off to each other.
    Like a carrot hung in front of a donkey in the Food Chain.
    Bed advertises highly when energy is low.
    Bed advertisement score modulated by relationship with bed, which increases with use so, you learn to sleep in the same place.
    
  action-queue: |
    Autonomous agents queue actions that
    satisfy their most urgent needs.

# ADVERTISEMENTS

  SIMULATE-NEEDS:
    score: 90
    condition: "Character behavior should be need-driven"
    
  CHECK-MOTIVATION:
