## The Slogan: Manufacturing Intelligence

| Reading | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **AI for Manufacturing** | Industrial applications -- factories, edge devices, production lines |
| **Building AI** | We manufacture intelligence systems |
| **Constructionism** | Papert -- intelligence is constructed, not innate |
| **Society of Mind** | Minsky -- intelligence manufactured from simple agents |
| **Manufacturing Consent** | Chomsky -- awareness of engineered agreement |
| **Growth Mindset** | Intelligence as product, not gift |
| **The Question** | Are we manufacturing genuine intelligence, or its appearance? |

The slogan is a K-line. Every reading reinforces the others.

## The Technology Stack

### 1. Neural-Symbolic Vision

Traditional computer vision answers **what**. Leela's neural-symbolic system answers **why**.

```yaml
# Traditional CV
detection:
  object: forklift
  confidence: 0.94
  
# Leela's neural-symbolic
inference:
  object: forklift
  confidence: 0.94
  context: loading_dock
  state: stationary_with_pallet
  
  why_stationary: |
    Waiting for clearance. 
    Worker in path (detected).
    Safety protocol active.
    
  causal_chain:
    - worker entered zone at T-3s
    - proximity sensor triggered
    - forklift brake engaged
    - waiting for zone_clear event
```

This is Drescher's [schema mechanism](../schema-mechanism/) applied to vision:
- **Context** -- what situation is this?
- **Action** -- what happened?
- **Result** -- what follows?
- **Why** -- causal chain explaining the inference

### 2. Edge Box Management

Industrial AI runs on edge devices -- compute boxes at the factory floor, not in the cloud.

```yaml
# edgebox-001.yml
edgebox:
  id: edgebox-001
  location: assembly_line_3
  status: healthy
  
  capabilities:
    - video_inference
    - sensor_fusion
    - local_alerting
    
  # MOOLLM pattern: box as room
  room:
    type: [compute, edge, industrial]
    contains:
      - camera_feed: rtsp://...
      - sensor_array: modbus://...
      - inference_engine: local
      
  # Speed of light: many inferences per second
  throughput:
    mode: real-time
    latency: low
```

The edgebox IS a [room](../room/). It has location, contains objects, processes state.

### 3. PDA App

Personal Data Assistant for field workers -- a third LLM layer on top of the symbolic/SQL layer:

```yaml
pda_app:
  purpose: |
    Bring AI insights to the human at the edge.
    Not just alerts -- explanations.
    Not just data -- actionable knowledge.
    
  # Three-layer architecture
  layers:
    1_neural: "Vision models detect, classify, track"
    2_symbolic: "Actions, SQL queries, inference rules"
    3_pda: "LLM interface -- neural yet symbolic"

  # PDA capabilities (all via SQL layer)
  pda_operations:
    - generate: "Natural language → SQL query"
    - perform: "Execute against temporal database"
    - interpret: "Results → human meaning"
    - explain: "Why this happened, what it means"
    - visualize: "Charts, timelines, spatial maps"
    - remember: "Query history, user preferences"

  # MOOLLM pattern: soul-chat with industrial objects
  interaction:
    user: "Why did the line stop?"
    pda_generates: |
      SELECT event, timestamp, cause_chain 
      FROM events 
      WHERE zone = 'assembly_line_3' 
      AND type = 'stoppage' 
      ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1
    pda_explains: |
      Thermal sensor on Station 7 exceeded threshold.
      Root cause: bearing friction on motor M-7-3.
      Predicted time to failure: 2-4 hours.
      Recommended: Replace bearing during next break.
```

The PDA is "kinda symbolic" -- it's an LLM, but it generates and interprets structured queries. Neural at the interface, symbolic in the protocol.

Everything speaks. The factory floor IS a [soul-chat](../soul-chat/).

### 4. DevOps Integration

MOOLLM patterns for infrastructure management:

```yaml
# Leela DevOps uses MOOLLM's files-as-state
infrastructure:
  pattern: |
    Directories are deployment targets.
    YAML files are configuration.
    Git is the audit trail.
    LLM is the coherence engine.
    
  applications:
    - deploy_orchestration
    - config_management
    - incident_response
    - root_cause_analysis
    
  # The coherence engine maintains consistency
  coherence:
    - detect drift between desired and actual state
    - propose remediation
    - explain changes in plain language
    - audit all modifications
```

## Drescher's Foundation

Gary Drescher's *Made-Up Minds* (1991) extended Piaget's developmental psychology with Minsky's computational framework:

| Drescher Concept | Leela Application |
|------------------|-------------------|
| **Schema** | Context → Action → Result patterns in vision |
| **Marginal Attribution** | Learning which features cause which outcomes |
| **Synthetic Items** | Inferred entities not directly observed |
| **Instrumental Conditioning** | Reward signals for system optimization |

The key insight: **You can learn causality from experience.**

Leela's vision system doesn't just detect patterns. It learns *why* those patterns matter.

```yaml
# Schema learning in action
schema:
  context: forklift_approaching_dock
  action: worker_enters_zone
  result: forklift_stops
  
  learned: |
    When workers enter forklift zones,
    forklifts stop (safety interlock).
    This is causal, not coincidental.
    
  marginal_attribution:
    worker_position: 0.92  # highly predictive
    time_of_day: 0.03      # not predictive
    lighting: 0.05         # minor factor
```

See: [schema-mechanism/](../schema-mechanism/)

## The Manufacturing Consent Question

Chomsky warned about manufactured consent in media.

Leela asks the question honestly: **What are we manufacturing?**

```yaml
ethics:
  transparency:
    - All inferences are explainable
    - Causal chains are auditable
    - No black box decisions for safety
    
  consent:
    - Workers know when they're observed
    - Data stays at the edge when possible
    - Privacy by design, not afterthought
    
  accountability:
    - Human in the loop for critical decisions
    - AI advises, humans decide
    - Audit trail for every action
```

Manufacturing intelligence responsibly means manufacturing *informed* consent.

*Manufacturing intelligence means manufacturing understanding. Not just pattern matching -- causal reasoning. Not just detection -- explanation. Not just AI -- knowledge.*
