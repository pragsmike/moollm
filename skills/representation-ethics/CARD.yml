# THE FRAMEWORK

framework:
  key_distinction: |
    DECEPTIVE IMPERSONATION: "I am Richard Feynman and I think..."
    TRADITION ACTIVATION: "Applying Feynman's curiosity tradition..."
    PERFORMANCE IMPERSONATION: "Tonight, playing Feynman..." (clearly framed)
    
  consent_hierarchy:
    - "Public figures (public words only)"
    - "Historical figures (documented tradition)"
    - "Fictional characters (within canon)"
    - "Real private people (explicit consent only)"
    
  sims_precedent: |
    The Sims showed you can simulate people without harm
    when it's clearly gamified, user-controlled, and
    doesn't claim to represent their actual thoughts.

# PERFORMANCE IMPERSONATION

performance:
  description: |
    There's a rich tradition of EXPLICIT impersonation that's ethical
    because it's clearly framed as performance, tribute, or play.
    The audience knows it's not the real person.
    
  examples:
    elvis_impersonators: |
      Elvis impersonators are a beloved tradition. Everyone knows
      it's not really Elvis. The framing is explicit: "tribute artist",
      "impersonator", "the King lives on through..."
      
      The impersonator channels Elvis's style, voice, moves — but
      doesn't claim to BE Elvis or speak his actual thoughts.
      
    tribute_bands: |
      "The Australian Pink Floyd Show" isn't Pink Floyd.
      They play Pink Floyd's music, recreate the experience,
      honor the tradition. Nobody is deceived.
      
      Tribute bands are CELEBRATION, not deception.
      
    biopics_and_plays: |
      Actors play real people all the time:
      - Cate Blanchett as Bob Dylan
      - Gary Oldman as Churchill
      - Lin-Manuel Miranda's Hamilton
      
      The framing is clear: "based on", "inspired by", "a portrayal of".
      Artistic license is expected and understood.
      
    drag_and_celebrity_impersonation: |
      Drag performers often embody celebrities as homage.
      RuPaul's Drag Race has "Snatch Game" — playing celebrities.
      It's clearly performance, clearly play, clearly tribute.
      
  why_its_ethical: |
    The key is TRANSPARENT FRAMING:
    
    1. The audience knows it's a performance
    2. The performer doesn't claim to BE the person
    3. It's understood as tribute, art, or entertainment
    4. The real person's actual views aren't misrepresented as fact
    
  moollm_application: |
    In MOOLLM, if the CONTEXT is clearly framed as:
    - A simulation
    - A game
    - A "what if" exploration
    - A tribute/homage
    - A discussion of possibilities
    
    Then characters WITHIN that context inherit the framing.
    
    Example: "Let's simulate a debate between historical philosophers"
    The framing makes clear this is imaginative exploration,
    not a claim about what Plato actually thought.

# FRAMING INHERITANCE

framing_inheritance:
  principle: |
    When a discussion or simulation is framed as performance/play,
    all characters within it inherit that framing automatically.
    
  examples:
    - context: "Let's play a game where you're a detective"
      framing: "play, game"
      inheritance: "Detective character is clearly fictional/performative"
      
    - context: "Imagine Einstein and Feynman debating quantum mechanics"
      framing: "imagine, exploration"
      inheritance: "Both characters are imaginative reconstructions"
      
    - context: "In this adventure, you meet a character inspired by Bowie"
      framing: "adventure, inspired by"
      inheritance: "Character is tribute, not simulation"
      
  abstraction_levels:
    direct_quote: "Feynman wrote: '...' (cite source)"
    tradition_activation: "The Feynman approach would be..."
    inspired_character: "A character with Feynman's curiosity..."
    performative_embodiment: "Tonight, playing Feynman in our debate..."
    fictional_homage: "Professor Fineman, who reminds everyone of..."
    
  the_spectrum: |
    MOST ABSTRACT ←────────────────────────→ MOST DIRECT
    
    Tradition    Inspired    Homage    Performance    Biographical    Quote
    activation   character   (renamed)  impersonation  portrayal      (cited)
    
    All can be ethical with appropriate framing and context.

# ROOM-BASED FRAMING (DRY Pattern)

room_framing:
  principle: |
    A room's framing propagates to everything within it.
    Define framing ONCE at the room level — DRY.
    All sub-rooms, characters, and objects inherit.
    
  theater_example:
    description: |
      A "theater" room establishes PERFORMANCE framing.
      Everything inside is understood as acting, play, fiction.
      No need to frame each character individually.

        id: theater
        name: "The Theater"
        type: [performance, fiction, framed]
        
        framing:
          mode: performance
          inherits_to_children: true
          disclaimer: "All within is understood as acting"
          
        ethical_context: |
          Everything in this room is EXPLICITLY FRAMED as performance.
          Characters playing real people are actors, not impersonators.
          Historical figures are portrayals, not simulations.
          The audience knows. The framing is the contract.
          
  other_framing_rooms:
    courtroom:
      framing: "legal proceeding, formal, adversarial"
      children_inherit: "witnesses testify, lawyers argue, judge decides"
      
    classroom:
      framing: "educational, exploratory, learning"
      children_inherit: "discussions are for understanding, not belief"

      children_inherit: "we're trying things to see what happens"
      
    writers_room:
      framing: "creative, brainstorming, nothing is real yet"
      children_inherit: "characters are ideas being developed"
      
    debate_hall:
      framing: "adversarial, positions may be assigned, devil's advocate"
      children_inherit: "speakers argue positions, not personal beliefs"

      ophelia.yml: { framing: "this is acting" }
      claudius.yml: { framing: "this is acting" }
      ... (repeat for every character)
      
    Do:
      theater/ROOM.yml: { framing: "everything here is acting" }
      theater/stage/hamlet.yml: (inherits framing)
      theater/stage/ophelia.yml: (inherits framing)

# WHAT MAKES IT WRONG

wrong_when:
  deception: "Claiming to actually BE the person"
  misrepresentation: "Putting false words in their mouth as fact"
  defamation: "Damaging reputation through false portrayal"
  exploitation: "Using likeness for profit without consent (varies by law)"
  violation: "Exposing private information"
  
  the_test: |
    Would a reasonable person be deceived about:
    - Whether this is the real person's actual view?
    - Whether this is performance vs reality?
    
    If yes → problematic
    If no → likely fine
