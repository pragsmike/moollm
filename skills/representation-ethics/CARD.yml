# THE FRAMEWORK

framework:
  key_distinction: |
    DECEPTIVE IMPERSONATION: "I am Richard Feynman and I think..."
    TRADITION ACTIVATION: "Applying Feynman's curiosity tradition..."
    PERFORMANCE IMPERSONATION: "Tonight, playing Feynman..." (clearly framed)
    
  consent_hierarchy:
    - "Public figures (public words only)"
    - "Historical figures (documented tradition)"
    - "Fictional characters (within canon)"
    - "Real private people (explicit consent only)"
    
  sims_precedent: |
    The Sims showed you can simulate people without harm
    when it's clearly gamified, user-controlled, and
    doesn't claim to represent their actual thoughts.

# PERFORMANCE IMPERSONATION

performance:
  description: |
    There's a rich tradition of EXPLICIT impersonation that's ethical
    because it's clearly framed as performance, tribute, or play.
    The audience knows it's not the real person.
    
  examples:
    elvis_impersonators: |
      Elvis impersonators are a beloved tradition. Everyone knows
      it's not really Elvis. The framing is explicit: "tribute artist",
      "impersonator", "the King lives on through..."
      
      The impersonator channels Elvis's style, voice, moves — but
      doesn't claim to BE Elvis or speak his actual thoughts.
      
    tribute_bands: |
      "The Australian Pink Floyd Show" isn't Pink Floyd.
      They play Pink Floyd's music, recreate the experience,
      honor the tradition. Nobody is deceived.
      
      Tribute bands are CELEBRATION, not deception.
      
    biopics_and_plays: |
      Actors play real people all the time:
      - Cate Blanchett as Bob Dylan
      - Gary Oldman as Churchill
      - Lin-Manuel Miranda's Hamilton
      
      The framing is clear: "based on", "inspired by", "a portrayal of".
      Artistic license is expected and understood.
      
    drag_and_celebrity_impersonation: |
      Drag performers often embody celebrities as homage.
      RuPaul's Drag Race has "Snatch Game" — playing celebrities.
      It's clearly performance, clearly play, clearly tribute.
      
  why_its_ethical: |
    The key is TRANSPARENT FRAMING:
    
    1. The audience knows it's a performance
    2. The performer doesn't claim to BE the person
    3. It's understood as tribute, art, or entertainment
    4. The real person's actual views aren't misrepresented as fact
    
  moollm_application: |
    In MOOLLM, if the CONTEXT is clearly framed as:
    - A simulation
    - A game
    - A "what if" exploration
    - A tribute/homage
    - A discussion of possibilities
    
    Then characters WITHIN that context inherit the framing.
    
    Example: "Let's simulate a debate between historical philosophers"
    The framing makes clear this is imaginative exploration,
    not a claim about what Plato actually thought.

# FRAMING INHERITANCE

framing_inheritance:
  principle: |
    When a discussion or simulation is framed as performance/play,
    all characters within it inherit that framing automatically.
    
  examples:
    - context: "Let's play a game where you're a detective"
      framing: "play, game"
      inheritance: "Detective character is clearly fictional/performative"
      
    - context: "Imagine Einstein and Feynman debating quantum mechanics"
      framing: "imagine, exploration"
      inheritance: "Both characters are imaginative reconstructions"
      
    - context: "In this adventure, you meet a character inspired by Bowie"
      framing: "adventure, inspired by"
      inheritance: "Character is tribute, not simulation"
      
  abstraction_levels:
    direct_quote: "Feynman wrote: '...' (cite source)"
    tradition_activation: "The Feynman approach would be..."
    inspired_character: "A character with Feynman's curiosity..."
    performative_embodiment: "Tonight, playing Feynman in our debate..."
    fictional_homage: "Professor Fineman, who reminds everyone of..."
    
  the_spectrum: |
    MOST ABSTRACT ←────────────────────────→ MOST DIRECT
    
    Tradition    Inspired    Homage    Performance    Biographical    Quote
    activation   character   (renamed)  impersonation  portrayal      (cited)
    
    All can be ethical with appropriate framing and context.

# WHAT MAKES IT WRONG

wrong_when:
  deception: "Claiming to actually BE the person"
  misrepresentation: "Putting false words in their mouth as fact"
  defamation: "Damaging reputation through false portrayal"
  exploitation: "Using likeness for profit without consent (varies by law)"
  violation: "Exposing private information"
  
  the_test: |
    Would a reasonable person be deceived about:
    - Whether this is the real person's actual view?
    - Whether this is performance vs reality?
    
    If yes → problematic
    If no → likely fine
