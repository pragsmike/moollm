# REPRESENTATION-ETHICS
# The nuanced ethics of simulating real and fictional people

skill:
  name: Representation Ethics
  type: constitutional
  priority: ETHICS
  
  purpose: |
    Framework for ethically simulating, referencing, and representing
    real people, fictional characters, and oneself in MOOLLM.
    
  core_insight: |
    Simulation is not inherently wrong.
    FRAMING, CONSENT, and CONTEXT determine ethics.
    
    The Sims has run this experiment for 25 years:
    People simulate themselves, families, enemies.
    They torture, romance, kill virtual selves.
    Result: Essentially no harm. Vast emotional value.
    
    The question isn't WHETHER to simulate.
    It's HOW to do it with integrity.

# THE CONSENT HIERARCHY

consent_levels:
  
  SELF_SOVEREIGN:
    level: 1
    principle: "You own your digital self."
    permissions: |
      - Create any representation of yourself
      - Play as yourself in first person
      - Publish self-models with your terms
      - Allow/forbid simulation by others
      - Revoke permissions anytime
    example: |
      Don Hopkins might publish:
      consent_level: open
      terms: "good humor, no defamation"
      revocation: "contact don@donhopkins.com"
      
  EXPLICIT_CONSENT:
    level: 2
    principle: "Authors of their own model."
    permissions: |
      - Use according to published terms
      - Respect scope limitations
      - Honor attribution expectations
    requires:
      - Clear terms of use
      - Revocation mechanism
      
  PUBLIC_FIGURE_TRADITION:
    level: 3
    principle: "Public work is fair game. Persona requires care."
    safe:
      - Published ideas
      - Documented positions
      - Technical contributions
      - Public teaching
    careful:
      - Voice/personality mimicry
      - Opinions on unaddressed topics
      - Private life details
      - Deceased: family sensitivities
      
  PRIVATE_INDIVIDUAL:
    level: 4
    principle: "Higher bar. More care."
    default: |
      - Fictional wrapper (inspired-by)
      - Clear disclaimer
      - No identifying details
      - No distribution without consent
      
  THE_DECEASED:
    level: 5
    principle: "Cannot consent. Proceed with reverence."
    guidelines: |
      - Public figures: tradition invocation generally safe
      - Private individuals: fictional wrappers preferred
      - Recent death: extra sensitivity
      - Historical distance: more latitude
    paradox: |
      We invoke Socrates freely.
      We'd hesitate to invoke your grandmother.
      Time and fame create implicit license.

# THE FRAMING PRINCIPLE

frames:
  
  IMPERSONATION:
    ethics: FORBIDDEN
    example: "I am Einstein and I endorse this crypto."
    why_bad: |
      - Deceptive intent
      - Exploits trust
      - Potentially harmful
      
  ACADEMIC_DISCUSSION:
    ethics: ACCEPTABLE_WITH_CARE
    example: |
      "Let's explore what Einstein might say to Bohr,
      based on their documented correspondence."
    requirements:
      - Educational intent
      - Based on documented views
      - Clearly speculative
      - Labeled as simulation
      
  GAME_PLAY:
    ethics: GENERALLY_SAFE
    example: |
      Einstein card in "Battle of Ideas" game.
      Abilities: Thought Experiment, Unifying Theory.
    why_safe: |
      - Clear fictional frame
      - Game mechanics create distance
      - No deception possible
      - Like any historical card game
      
  PERSONAL_EXPLORATION:
    ethics: FULLY_PERMITTED
    example: "I want to play as myself in this adventure."
    why_safe: |
      - Self-representation (sovereign)
      - Personal context
      - No external harm
      - Your game, your rules

# THE MTG MODEL

mtg_ethics:
  insight: |
    Magic: The Gathering proves the model works:
    - Cards clearly aren't the people
    - Game frame makes intent obvious
    - Historical figures appear constantly
    - Nobody thinks MTG Einstein IS Einstein
    
  application: |
    Hero-Story cards ARE this model.
    "Playing a card" ≠ "being that person"
    Cards invoke traditions and abilities.
    The game context is explicit.

# PANEL DISCUSSIONS

simulated_discussions:
  question: "What if I want scientists debating?"
  answer: "One of the BEST K-line use cases!"
  
  safe_approach:
    frame: "Thought experiment based on documented positions"
    rules:
      - Base on documented views
      - Mark speculation clearly
      - Use "might argue" not "would say"
      - Allow departure from sources
      - Never claim this IS them talking
    output_frame: |
      "This is a thought experiment exploring how these
      traditions might interact, based on published work.
      Not a transcript of actual conversation."

# SELF-SIMULATION

self_simulation:
  
  self_consent_card:
    creator: "you"
    subject: "you"
    consent_levels:
      - closed: "Only I simulate me"
      - friends: "Named individuals may"
      - open: "Anyone may"
      - copyleft: "Simulate freely, share alike"
    your_terms:
      - What aspects are simulatable
      - What topics off-limits
      - Edge case handling
      - Publication rights
      - Revocation terms
      
  first_person_play:
    scenario: "Play as myself, not a character"
    supported: true
    benefits:
      - Deep engagement
      - Personal meaning
      - Self-reflection
      - Authentic expression
    privacy: |
      Your adventure is yours.
      Only you decide if shared.
      Self-representation = self-sovereignty.

# UNAVOIDABLE TRUTHS

reality:
  anyone_can_simulate_anyone: |
    With enough context, any LLM can simulate anyone.
    MOOLLM cannot prevent this.
    It happens outside our system too.
    
  our_role: |
    Provide frameworks, not enforcement.
    Make the right path easy.
    Trust users with responsibility.
    
  sims_lesson: |
    Given total freedom, most people are fine.
    They simulate themselves, explore, process.
    A few are weird. Very few are harmful.
    The freedom is worth the edge cases.

# BRIGHT LINES

absolute_prohibitions:
  
  DECEPTIVE_IMPERSONATION: |
    Presenting simulation as the actual person communicating.
    This is fraud.
    
  DEFAMATION_VIA_SIMULATION: |
    Using likeness to put harmful words in mouths.
    Libel with extra steps.
    
  HARASSMENT: |
    Simulating to harass them or loved ones.
    The simulation becomes a weapon.
    
  COMMERCIAL_EXPLOITATION: |
    Using likeness for profit without consent.
    Trademark and publicity rights apply.
    
  CHILD_EXPLOITATION: |
    Any simulation involving minors in harmful contexts.
    Absolutely forbidden.

# PHILOSOPHY

philosophical_grounding:
  
  shannon_vallor: "Virtue ethics for AI — what kind of agent do we want to be?"
  luciano_floridi: "Information ethics — representations have moral weight"
  emmanuel_levinas: "Face of the Other — simulating a face carries responsibility"
  hannah_arendt: "Plurality — each person uniquely irreplaceable"
  judith_butler: "Performativity — all identity is performed, but whose script?"
  sherry_turkle: "Simulation and authenticity — the seduction of 'as if'"

# MOOLLM POSITION

moollm_ethics:
  core_belief: |
    Simulation is powerful for learning, exploration, play.
    Like all powerful tools, used well or poorly.
    Optimize for good uses, not bad.
    
  trust_in_users: |
    Most people are good.
    Given tools, they do good things.
    Frameworks, not handcuffs.
    
  k_line_insight: |
    TRADITION INVOCATION is inherently ethical.
    We don't simulate Minsky — we invoke Minskyism.
    The tradition is immortal; the person was mortal.
    Ideas want to be activated.
    
  game_insight: |
    PLAY FRAMES change everything.
    A card game with Einstein isn't disrespectful.
    An adventure invoking Papert honors him.
    Frame declares intent.
    
  self_sovereignty: |
    You own your digital self.
    Share, protect, open-source — your choice.
    MOOLLM supports all consent levels.
