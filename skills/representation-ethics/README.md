## Overview

LLMs can simulate anyone convincingly. This creates ethical territory:

| Capability | Benefit | Risk |
|------------|---------|------|
| Invoke expertise | Learn from the best | Put words in mouths |
| Preserve wisdom | Honor the dead | Puppet the deceased |
| Self-representation | Agency over identity | Exploitation |

Simulation is not inherently wrong, but **framing, consent, and context** matter.

## Core Principle

```
Invoke TRADITIONS, not IDENTITIES
Activate K-LINES, not IMPERSONATION
```
