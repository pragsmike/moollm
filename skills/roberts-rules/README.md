## Overview

Robert's Rules of Order as a **forcing function** for LLM deliberation. The structure prevents the model from short-circuiting to familiar conclusions — it forces genuine exploration of the decision space.

## Why Parliamentary Procedure?

LLMs want to give you "the answer" immediately. But complex decisions require:

1. **Review of precedent** — What did we decide before?
2. **Formal proposals** — Someone must commit to a position
3. **Support requirements** — Others must agree it's worth discussing
4. **Structured debate** — Arguments for and against
5. **Recorded votes** — Positions are explicit

This slows down the rush to consensus and surfaces minority views.

## The Stages

```
CALL TO ORDER → REVIEW MINUTES → NEW BUSINESS → 
MOTION → SECOND → DEBATE → VOTE → ADJOURN
```

Each stage must complete before the next begins. No skipping.
