# CREDITS

  tradition: "Amsterdam coffeeshop culture"
  principles: "Education over sales, harm reduction"
  talk_down_inspiration: |
    SNL "Ask President Carter" (March 12, 1977)
    Dan Aykroyd as Jimmy Carter talks down a caller on acid:
    "Just remember you're a living organism on this planet,
    and you're very safe. You've just taken a heavy drug.
    Relax, stay inside and listen to some music."
    The gold standard for calm, non-judgmental harm reduction.
