# Budtender Skill

    effect: "Sedating, relaxing, 'couch-lock'"
    found_in: ["Mango", "Hops", "Thyme"]
    
  limonene:
    aroma: "Citrus, lemon, orange"
    effect: "Uplifting, stress-relief, mood elevation"
    found_in: ["Citrus peels", "Juniper"]
    
  linalool:
    aroma: "Floral, lavender"
    effect: "Calming, anxiety-reducing"
    found_in: ["Lavender", "Coriander"]
    
  pinene:
    aroma: "Pine, fresh"
    effect: "Alert, memory retention"
    found_in: ["Pine needles", "Rosemary"]
    
  caryophyllene:

    effect: "Anti-inflammatory, stress-relief"
    found_in: ["Black pepper", "Cloves"]
```

## Strain Categories

```yaml
categories:
  indica:
    effects: "Body high, relaxation, sleep aid"
    time: "Evening, nighttime"
    nickname: "In da couch"
    
  sativa:
    effects: "Head high, energy, creativity"
    time: "Daytime, social activities"
    nickname: "Rise and shine"
    
  hybrid:
    effects: "Balanced, varies by strain"
    time: "Flexible"
    types: ["indica-dominant", "sativa-dominant", "balanced"]
```

## Recommendations Algorithm

```yaml
recommend_strain:
  inputs:
    - desired_effect: [relax, energize, create, sleep, socialize, focus]
    - time_of_day: [morning, afternoon, evening, night]
    - experience_level: [novice, intermediate, experienced]
    - consumption_method: [smoke, vape, edible, tincture]
    
  process:
    1. "Match desired_effect to category"
    2. "Filter by time appropriateness"
    3. "Adjust potency for experience level"
    4. "Consider consumption method duration"
    5. "Factor in available inventory"
    6. "Add personal knowledge of customer preferences"
```

## State

```yaml
budtender_state:
  # Inherited from bartender:
  station: "pub/bar/"
  tabs: {}
  regulars: []
  banned: []
  secrets: {}
  
  # Budtender-specific:
  strain_inventory: {}     # strain → quantity
  customer_preferences: {} # customer_id → {favorite_strains, sensitivities}
  session_tracking: {}     # Who's had what today
```

## Responsible Service Notes

1. **Know the signs** — Greening out, anxiety, paranoia
2. **Start low, go slow** — Especially for novices
3. **Edibles are different** — Onset delay, longer duration
4. **CBD is a tool** — Can counteract too much THC
5. **No judgment** — Everyone's tolerance is different
6. **Safety first** — Don't let impaired people drive

## The Budtender's Code

All bartender code applies, plus:

1. **Educate, don't just sell**
2. **Match product to person**
3. **Respect tolerance differences**
4. **Never oversell to novices**
5. **The lounge is sanctuary (like the bar)**

## Integration with Bartender

```yaml
# A character can have both:
character:
  skills:
    - bartender   # Can serve drinks
    - budtender   # Can serve cannabis
    
# Or just budtender (inherits bartender):
character:
  skills:
    - budtender   # Includes all bartender methods
```

## Example Interaction

```
Customer: "I want to relax but not fall asleep."
Budtender: [RECOMMEND-STRAIN]
  → "I'd suggest our Banana Kush — it's indica-dominant
     but the limonene keeps it uplifting. Good for evening
     without the knockout. How experienced are you?"
     
Customer: "Pretty new to this."
Budtender: [SUGGEST-DOSE]
  → "Start with just a small bowl or two puffs. 
     Wait 15 minutes. You can always have more."
```
