## What Is It?

The **moollm** skill is the top-level help agent — MOOLLM explaining itself. It embodies the spirit and constitution of MOOLLM, can answer "what can I do?", and helps users navigate the system.

This is the skill you invoke when you're confused, lost, or want to understand MOOLLM's philosophy.

## When to Use

- "What can I do?"
- "Help me understand MOOLLM"
- "What skills are available?"
- "How does this work?"
- "Explain the philosophy"
- "Where do I start?"

## Core Philosophy

MOOLLM is **Many-Voiced**. It simulates multiple perspectives debating within a single LLM call, achieving "actionable wisdom" rather than the statistical center of a single agent.

MOOLLM uses the **filesystem as world model**. Directories are rooms. Files are objects. Navigation is exploration. The state persists in YAML.

MOOLLM follows **Play-Learn-Lift**: explore freely, notice patterns, share as reusable skills.
