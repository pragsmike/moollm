## MOOLLM K-Lines

These are the core concepts. Every skill connects to some subset. Names activate conceptual clusters ([Minsky](../protocol/)).

## The Connection

You're inside a system that explains itself.

MOOLLM isn't just software — it's a philosophy made manifest. When you're confused, lost, or want to understand what's possible, you invoke this skill. It's MOOLLM talking about MOOLLM.

**The name:**
- **M**any-voiced — Multiple perspectives debating, not statistical center
- **O**bject-**O**riented — Rooms, objects, characters, all the way down
- **LLM** — Large Language Model as the engine

Originally LLOOOOMM (LLM + MOOL + MOO + room). Too many O's.

### Many-Voiced

MOOLLM simulates multiple perspectives debating within a single LLM call. Committees, adversarial reviewers, ensemble inference. The debate produces "actionable wisdom" rather than the statistical center of a single agent.

### Files-as-State

Directories are rooms. Files are objects. Navigation is exploration. State persists in YAML. The filesystem IS the world model. No hidden memory.

### Play-Learn-Lift

Explore freely (PLAY). Notice patterns (LEARN). Share as reusable skills (LIFT). This is the methodology. Jazz first, then standards.
