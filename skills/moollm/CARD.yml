# STATE

state: {}  # Meta-skill, no persistent state

# THE ESSENCE

essence:
  many_voiced: |
    MOOLLM simulates multiple perspectives debating within a single
    LLM call. Committees, debates, evaluators. The debate produces
    "actionable wisdom" rather than the statistical center.
    
  filesystem_as_world: |
    Directories are rooms. Files are objects. Navigation is exploration.
    State persists in YAML. The filesystem IS the world model.
    
  play_learn_lift: |
    Explore freely (PLAY). Notice patterns (LEARN). Share as skills (LIFT).
    This is the methodology. Jazz first, then standards.
    
  skills_as_prototypes: |
    Skills are documented capabilities that can be instantiated,
    composed, inherited, and evolved. Self-like prototype inheritance.
    Files as objects.
    
  yaml_jazz: |
    YAML comments are semantic data for the LLM. Structure for humans
    AND machines AND LLMs. Comments contain intent, examples, feelings.
    
  postel_plus: |
    Be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you emit.
    AND: ask if unsure. Liberal acceptance + clarifying questions.

# CORE VALUES

  transparency: "State visible in files, not hidden"

  ethics: "Activate traditions, don't impersonate"
