# CARD.yml — The Prototype Card
#
# Philosophy of prototype-based inheritance.
# "Objects clone from prototypes, not instances from classes."

card:
  id: prototype
  name: "Prototype Philosophy"
  type: [skill, philosophy, inheritance]
  
  emoji: 🧬
  
  rarity: rare  # Foundational but abstract
  
  description: |
    The Self programming language philosophy applied to MOOLLM.
    Objects are concrete. Classes don't exist. Everything delegates.
    
    Play this card to understand or explain prototype-based inheritance,
    or when designing new prototype/instance relationships.

# TOOLS REQUIRED
# This is pure philosophy — no tools needed

tools:
  required: []
  optional:
    - read_file  # To examine prototype chains

tier: 0  # Knowledge only

# METHODS
# What this card can do when played

methods:
  
  EXPLAIN:
    description: "Explain prototype inheritance to someone"
    parameters:
      audience: "Who needs to understand (developer, designer, novice)"
      context: "What they're trying to build"
    output: chat
    effect: |
      Generate an explanation tailored to the audience,
      using concrete examples from the current context.
      
  DESIGN:
    description: "Design a prototype relationship"
    parameters:
      thing: "What needs prototypes (character, room, skill)"
      capabilities: "What it should inherit"
    output: chat + yaml
    effect: |
      1. Identify appropriate prototypes
      2. Design PROTOTYPES.yml structure
      3. Document what inherits vs overrides
      
  TRACE:
    description: "Trace a delegation chain"
    parameters:
      instance_path: "Path to instance"
      slot_name: "What you're looking for"
    output: chat
    effect: |
      Walk the prototype chain showing where slot_name
      resolves, or report if unresolved.
      
  COMPARE:
    description: "Compare prototype vs class inheritance"
    parameters:
      scenario: "What you're modeling"
    output: chat
    effect: |
      Show how the scenario would work in both paradigms,
      explaining tradeoffs and why prototype fits MOOLLM.
