# CARD.yml — Time

# Simulation turns vs LLM iterations — narrative time flow.

    Simulation turns are NOT LLM iterations. A single LLM response
    might cover many turns. The LLM judges how time passes based
    on context and narrative.

# METHODS

methods:
  
  TICK:
    description: "Advance time by one turn"
    parameters: {}
    output: state-change
    effect: "Increment turn, trigger time-based effects"
    invoked-by: [simulation, player]
    
  WAIT:
    description: "Pass time intentionally"
    parameters:
      turns: "How many (or natural language)"
    output: chat + state-change
    effect: "Advance time, describe passage"
    invoked-by: [player]
    
  PAUSE:
    description: "Stop time advancement"
    parameters: {}
    output: state-change

  RESUME:

    parameters: {}
    output: state-change
    effect: "Unfreeze time"
    invoked-by: [player]
    
  STATUS:

    parameters: {}
    output: chat
    effect: "Display turn, time of day"
    invoked-by: [player]

# STATE

state:
  time-schema:
    turn:
      type: integer
    time-of-day:
      type: string
    advancement:
      type: enum
      values: [paused, slow, normal, fast]

# THE DISTINCTION

distinction:
  simulation-turn: |
    Abstract game time unit.
    Buffs last "5 turns".
    One room navigation = one turn.
    
  llm-iteration: |
    One request/response cycle.
    One LLM response might cover many turns.
    Or many responses might be one turn (conversation).
    
  llm-judges: |
    "About 5 minutes" — LLM interprets contextually.
    "Until morning" — LLM advances appropriately.
    Natural language durations work.

    Simulation time management. Turns are abstract game time,
    not LLM response iterations. One turn per room navigation
    is a good default.
