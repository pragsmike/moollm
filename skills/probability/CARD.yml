# HOW IT WORKS

mechanism:
  no_dice: |
    No random number generators. The LLM evaluates
    probability narratively, considering:
    - Character stats
    - Buffs and debuffs
    - Context and stakes
    - Story needs
    
  outcomes: ["Critical success", "Success", "Partial", "Failure", "Critical failure"]
