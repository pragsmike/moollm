# SKILL — The Meta-Skill
# "A skill is documentation that learned to do things."

skill:
  name: skill
  protocol: SKILL
  tier: 1
  
  description: >
    The meta-protocol defining how skills work, evolve, and compose.
    Skills are documented capabilities that can be instantiated anywhere.
  
  # What this skill invokes (K-lines)
  invokes:
    - programming-by-demonstration  # Alan Cypher, Brad Myers, Henry Lieberman
    - constructionism               # Papert — learn by building
    - anthropic-skills              # Documentation-first tool definition
    - play-learn-lift               # The development lifecycle
    
  # Core concepts
  concepts:
    central_skills:
      location: "skills/"
      purpose: "Shared, reusable, general-purpose capabilities"
      example: "room, card, adventure, play-learn-lift"
      
    local_skills:
      location: "In rooms, characters, objects"
      purpose: "Context-specific, specialized, emergent"
      example: "maze-mapping learned by player, food-prep in kitchen"
      
    skill_inheritance:
      mechanism: "Local skills inherit from central, add local knowledge"
      example: "player.skills inherits play-learn-lift, adds grue-avoidance"
      
    skill_composition:
      mechanism: "Complex skills built from simple ones"
      example: "adventure-exploration composes room + card + soul-chat"
  
  # The lifecycle
  lifecycle:
    play:
      description: "Explore by doing, no formal skill yet"
      output: "Experience, trial and error, raw observations"
      
    learn:
      description: "Notice patterns, understand what works"
      output: "Informal procedures, mental models"
      
    lift:
      description: "Extract reusable skill, document it"
      output: "README.md, PROTOTYPE.yml, maybe sister_script"

  # Integration
  integrates_with:
    - play-learn-lift   # The methodology
    - sister-script     # When skills become scripts
    - room              # Skills live in rooms
    - card              # Skills can be cards
    - constructionism   # Building skills by doing

# Remember: Skills are living documents.
# They start as prose, become procedures, crystallize into scripts.
# The documentation is always the source of truth.
