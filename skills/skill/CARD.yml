    The meta-skill for creating, understanding, and debugging skills.
    
    Every skill you encounter was forged here. This card teaches
    the art of skill creation — from documentation to automation,
    from prototype inheritance to instantiation.
    
    Play this card when you need to:
    - Create a new skill from scratch
    - Understand how skills inherit from prototypes
    - Debug a skill that isn't working
    - Upgrade a skill's capabilities
