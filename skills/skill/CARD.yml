    The meta-skill for creating, understanding, and debugging skills.
    
    Every skill you encounter was forged here. This card teaches
    the art of skill creation — from documentation to automation,
    from prototype inheritance to empathic instantiation.
    
    MOOLLM's unique contributions:
    - **Instantiation**: Skills as prototypes that create instances
    - **K-lines**: Names as semantic activation vectors
    - **Empathic Templates**: Smart generation, not string substitution
    - **Speed of Light**: Proven 33-turn multi-agent simulation

tools:
  required: [read_file, write_file]
  optional: [list_dir, grep]
tier: 1

# METHODS — What this card can do when played

  CREATE:
    description: "Create a new skill from scratch"
    parameters:
      name: "lowercase-with-dashes"
      description: "One-line summary"
      tier: "0, 1, or 2"
      prototypes: "Optional parent skills"
    effect: |
      1. Create skills/{name}/ directory
      2. Generate README.md (human landing page)
      3. Generate SKILL.md (full spec)
      4. Generate CARD.yml (interface)
      5. Register in INDEX.yml
      6. Return the new skill card
      
  INSTANTIATE:
    description: "Create instance from skill prototype"
    parameters:
      skill: "Path to skill"
      location: "Where to create instance"
      context: "Semantic context for empathic templates"
    effect: |
      1. Read skill's templates
      2. Apply empathic template expansion (not just string substitution!)
      3. Write instance files to location
      4. Create PROTOTYPES.yml pointing to skill
      5. Return activation record
    note: "Lightweight objects can be embedded in logs as YAML Jazz code blocks"
      
  DEBUG:
    description: "Diagnose why a skill isn't working"
    parameters:
      skill-path: "Path to skill or instance"
    effect: |
      1. Check file structure (README.md, SKILL.md, CARD.yml)
      2. Verify prototype chain (PROTOTYPES.yml resolution)
      3. Test template rendering
      4. Report issues and fixes
      5. Generate dynamic stack traces for analysis
      
  UPGRADE:
    description: "Evolve a skill's capabilities"
    parameters:
      skill: "Path to skill"
      new-tier: "Target tier (0→1, 1→2)"
    effect: |
      1. Analyze current capability
      2. Identify what's needed for upgrade
      3. Add required templates/tools
      4. Update INDEX.yml
      
  LIFT:
    description: "Extract local skill to central directory"
    parameters:
      source: "Path to local skill or learned pattern"
      name: "Name for the new central skill"
    effect: |
      1. Analyze the local skill/pattern
      2. Generalize to remove instance-specific details
      3. Create new skill in skills/{name}/
      4. Generate proper README.md, SKILL.md, CARD.yml
      5. Register in INDEX.yml
      
  COMPOSE:
    description: "Combine multiple skills into a new composite skill"
    parameters:
      skills: "List of skills to compose"
      name: "Name for composite"
      orchestration: "How they interact"
    effect: |
      1. Create composite skill
      2. Reference component skills in PROTOTYPES.yml
      3. Document orchestration in SKILL.md

# STATE — What instances of this skill track

state:
  current-skill: "Skill being worked on"

  instantiation-context: "Context for empathic templates"

# UNIQUE MOOLLM FEATURES

moollm-innovations:
  
  instantiation:
    description: "Skills are prototypes that create instances"
    unlike: "Static documentation that's only read"
    example: |
      skills/adventure/  →  examples/adventure-4/
      (prototype)            (instance with state)
    
  k-lines:
    description: "Names activate entire knowledge contexts"
    source: "Marvin Minsky, Society of Mind"
    example: |
      Invoking "YAML-JAZZ" activates:
      - The commenting philosophy
      - Syntax patterns
      - Examples and anti-patterns
      - Related concepts
      
  empathic-templates:
    description: "Smart semantic instantiation"
    unlike: "Mechanical string substitution"
    example: |
      {{describe_character}} generates coherent prose
      based on context, not just slot filling
      
  three-tier-persistence:
    description: "Platform → Narrative → State"
    unlike: "Single flat state"
    tiers:
      platform: "Ephemeral (chat session)"
      narrative: "Read-mostly (LOG.md data islands)"
      state: "Read-write (*.yml files)"
      
  speed-of-light:
    description: "Many agents, many turns, one LLM call"
    proven:
      - "33-turn Stoner Fluxx (8+ characters)"
      - "21-turn Cat Prowl (10 cats in parallel)"
      - "Palm incarnation tribunal"

# PHILOSOPHY
#
# Skills evolve through use:
#   PLAY: Do it manually, learn what works
#   LEARN: Notice patterns, document them
#   LIFT: Crystallize into reusable skill
#
# The skill skill is the forge where this happens.
#
# MOOLLM's contribution: Skills aren't just documentation.
# They're prototypes. They instantiate. They inherit.
# They compose. They're proven in extended simulation.
