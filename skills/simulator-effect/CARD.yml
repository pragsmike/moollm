# The skill interface -- what this skill advertises

card:
  name: simulator-effect
  version: 1.0.0
  tagline: "Implication is more efficient than simulation"
  
  # What this skill provides
  provides:
    - IMPLY -- Instead of simulating, imply
    - SEED -- Provide imagination seeds
    - SPARSE -- Deliberately omit for richness
    - ARCHETYPE -- Use cultural shortcuts
    - JAZZ -- Comments as imagination seeds
    
  # What needs this skill satisfies
  satisfies:
    - need: creative_generation
      strength: high
      method: sparse specs, rich interpretation
    - need: character_depth
      strength: high
      method: archetypes activate personality clusters
    - need: world_building
      strength: high
      method: sensory seeds, imagination renders
    - need: efficiency
      strength: high
      method: minimal tokens, maximum meaning
      
  # When to use this skill
  use_when:
    - creating characters from minimal specs

    - writing sparse but evocative content
    - leveraging cultural archetypes
    - fighting mode-collapse with structure
    
  # When NOT to use this skill
  avoid_when:
    - precise specifications required (contracts, APIs)
    - deterministic behavior needed
    - no room for interpretation

  # Key insight
  insight: |
    Players imagine simulations are vastly more detailed, deep, rich, 
    and complex than they actually are. This is not a bug to fix -- 
    it is the most powerful rendering engine ever built. Off-load 
    computation into the user's brain. Provide seeds, not simulations.
    
  # Proof
  proof:
    - name: "The Astrillogical Effect"
      year: 1997
      description: |
        The Sims displayed zodiac signs with zero behavioral code.
        Testers reported the zodiac was "too influential."
        There was no influence to tune. Purely imagined.
