# Mind Mirror

> *"Mirrors should reflect a little before throwing back images."* — Jean Cocteau

> *"The ultimate intimacy is where you show them your personal database — you show your Mind Mirror."* — Timothy Leary

## What It Is

**Mind Mirror** (1985) was Timothy Leary's software for digitizing consciousness. Published by Electronic Arts when EA made weird beautiful things, it brought academic psychology to personal computers decades before modern personality apps.

This skill brings that system into MOOLLM as a framework for modeling characters, NPCs, and exploring personality dynamics.

## The Origin Story

In 1950, Timothy Leary completed his PhD dissertation at UC Berkeley: *"The Social Dimensions of Personality: Group Process and Structure."* This pioneering work developed the **Interpersonal Circumplex** — a geometric model mapping all human personality on two axes:

```
                    DOMINANCE
                        ↑
                        |
          Arrogant   ───┼───   Confident
                        |
    HOSTILITY ←─────────┼─────────→ AFFILIATION
                        |
          Timid      ───┼───   Docile
                        |
                        ↓
                   SUBMISSION
```

Thirty-five years later, Leary collaborated with programmers Peter Van den Beemt and Bob Dietz to transform this academic work into interactive software.

## The Prison Escape: Ultimate Validation

In 1970, Leary was given psychological tests upon prison intake — including the **Leary Interpersonal Behavior Inventory**, a test he himself had designed.

Understanding exactly what it measured, Leary answered strategically:
- Appeared mild-mannered, conforming
- Showed interest in forestry and gardening
- Displayed no leadership tendencies
- Expressed respect for authority

**Result:** Classified minimum security. Assigned outdoor work detail. Escaped by climbing a tree near the perimeter fence and shimmying along a telephone cable over the razor wire.

**The lesson:** Understanding how you're measured gives you power. Consciousness of systems enables transcendence.

## Leary's Philosophy

### The Mirror Metaphor

> *"Remember the title — it's a mirror. Now a best friend is your mirror because your mirror doesn't say 'well you bad boy get a haircut' or the mirror doesn't say 'hey turkey fix your tie' — you have to decide that. It's your own mind and we all have these thoughts in our mind made up of these complicated little, you know, Erector Set structures."*

### Consciousness as Software

> *"This software program allows you to digitalize your thoughts."*

The brain is a biocomputer. Consciousness is its software. Just as software can be debugged and upgraded, so can the mind.

### The PC is the LSD of the 1990s

> *"I turned on that Apple computer, and it was like taking psychedelics all over again. The screen lit up, I could control what appeared, I could create realities, store them, share them. I realized this was the tool we'd been looking for — a consciousness-expanding technology that was legal, accessible, and infinitely programmable."*

**Evolution:**
- **1960s:** Turn on, tune in, drop out (consciousness via chemistry)
- **1980s:** Turn on, boot up, jack in (consciousness via computers)

### The Ultimate Intimacy

> *"The ultimate intimacy is... you can love them, you can sleep with them, safe sex of course, and then you can even get married. But the real intimacy is where you show them your personal database — you show your Mind Mirror."*

### Generational Power

> *"You're the first generation in human history to know how to control your own nervous system, change your own reality. Tune in and take over! Blow your own mind, make up your own mind."*

## Bob Dietz on the Development

Bob Dietz, co-creator, on working with Leary:

> *"His vision was way out there in the future so a lot of what we had to do was kind of pull it back a little bit and say well, this machine can't do all that. He always had these kind of big vision things of wanting to do three-dimensionally and you know have the computer react to everything you said and with artificial intelligence."*

On Leary's goals:

> *"He was all about self-empowerment, giving the users the keys to the kingdom."*

On the internet vision:

> *"I cannot begin to tell you how much Timothy Leary would have embraced and loved the notion of seeing Mind Mirror applied on the internet."*

## In MOOLLM: The Living Personality System

Mind Mirror becomes dynamic infrastructure for characters and entities.

### Character DNA

Every MOOLLM entity can have a Mind Mirror profile defining its personality.

**But here's the magic:** The comments aren't just documentation — MOOLLM *reads* them. The LLM interprets YAML Jazz comments as semantic modulation of the data. Comments explain, qualify, contextualize, and *drive behavior*.

```yaml
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# CAPTAIN ASHFORD — Mind Mirror Profile
# 
# This is YAML JAZZ. Every comment here is DATA that the LLM reads and uses.
# Numbers set the dial. Comments explain what it MEANS for THIS character.
# The same "confident: 6" means different things for different people.
# Comments make personality SPECIFIC, VIVID, ALIVE.
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

character:
  name: "Captain Ashford"
  
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # MIND MIRROR PROFILE
  # Leary's four planes, rated 0-7, with YAML Jazz commentary
  # The numbers are the skeleton. The comments are the flesh.
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  
  mind_mirror:
  
    bio_energy:
      # Life force, vitality, temperament — how alive do they feel?
      
      energetic: 6       # Bounces when walking. Talks with hands.
                         # Can't sit still in a chair — always drumming fingers.
                         # First one up, last one to admit being tired.
                         
      cheerful: 5        # Default mood is "amused by existence."
                         # Smiles at danger. Laughs at own jokes.
                         # BUT: cheerfulness masks deeper anxieties.
                         
      restless: 4        # Always scanning the room. Planning next move.
                         # Comfortable silence? What's that?
                         # Will volunteer for any mission just to MOVE.
                         
    emotional_insight:
      # Interpersonal style — how do they approach others?
      
      confident: 6       # Walks into rooms like they own them.
                         # Never apologizes for existing.
                         # Will bluff with a terrible hand and WIN.
                         # (Secretly terrified of failure. Tells no one.)
                         
      friendly: 5        # Genuine warmth, not performance.
                         # Remembers names. Asks follow-up questions.
                         # BUT: keeps emotional distance. Burned before.
                         
    mental_abilities:
      # Knowledge, creativity — how do they process information?
      
      creative: 6        # Solutions from left field. "What if we..."
                         # Sees connections others miss.
                         # Will try the ridiculous approach FIRST.
                         # Makes lateral leaps that leave others dizzy.
                         
      innovative: 5      # Improves everything they touch.
                         # "The old way works, but have you considered..."
                         # Restless mind that can't leave well enough alone.
                         
    social_interaction:
      # Class, sophistication — how do they fit in society?
      
      uninhibited: 5     # Says what they think. Mostly.
                         # Social conventions are "suggestions."
                         # Will tell the emperor about the clothes situation.
                         # Sometimes regrets this. Usually doesn't.
                         
      worldly: 4         # Traveled. Seen things. Has OPINIONS about wine.
                         # Not a snob, but has standards.
                         # Can navigate fancy dinner AND tavern brawl.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# HOW MOOLLM USES THIS:
#
# 1. DIALOGUE GENERATION
#    "confident: 6 + 'walks into rooms like they own them'"
#    → Character enters scene with authority, not hesitation
#    → Never says "Um, excuse me, sorry to bother you..."
#    → Says "Right. Here's what we're going to do."
#
# 2. DECISION MAKING  
#    "creative: 6 + 'will try the ridiculous approach FIRST'"
#    → When stuck, character proposes wild solutions
#    → Doesn't exhaust sensible options before getting weird
#    → "What if we disguise ourselves as furniture?"
#
# 3. INTERNAL MONOLOGUE
#    "confident: 6 + 'secretly terrified of failure. Tells no one.'"
#    → Public: "I've got this handled."
#    → Private: "Please don't let me screw this up."
#    → The gap between these IS the character.
#
# 4. NPC REACTIONS
#    "uninhibited: 5 + 'will tell the emperor about the clothes'"
#    → NPCs react to directness — some respect it, some resent it
#    → Pompous characters get deflated
#    → Honest characters become allies
#
# 5. NARRATIVE VOICE
#    All comments combine into a distinctive presence.
#    You FEEL Captain Ashford in every line.
#    The YAML Jazz IS the character.
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**The Key Insight:** Numbers alone are dead data. Numbers + YAML Jazz comments = living character.

### Soul-Chat Voice Calibration

Mind Mirror dimensions influence how characters speak:
- High **assertiveness** → direct statements
- High **creativity** → metaphors and tangents
- High **cheerful** → upbeat tone

### Dynamic Simulation with YAML Jazz

Mind Mirror isn't static — it's **living YAML Jazz** that drives narrative:

```yaml
character:
  name: "Captain Ashford"
  
  # PERSONALITY (stable traits)
  mind_mirror:
    confident: 6      # Doesn't hesitate
    creative: 6       # Unusual solutions
    restless: 5       # Can't sit still
    proud: 4          # Won't ask for help easily
    
  # NEEDS (Sims-style, fluctuate constantly)
  needs:
    hunger: 3         # Getting peckish... food ads score higher
    energy: 4         # Tired but pushing through
    fun: 2            # BORED. Will seek entertainment.
    social: 6         # Just had a good chat with bartender
    hygiene: 5        # Acceptable. For an adventurer.
    bladder: 7        # Fine for now
    comfort: 3        # These dungeon floors are hard
    room: 4           # Treasure chamber is nice but dusty
    # Low needs drive autonomous behavior via advertisements
    
  # SHORT-TERM GOALS (immediate desires)
  wants:
    - "Find something to eat"           # hunger is 3
    - "Do something fun"                # fun is 2!
    - "Rest somewhere comfortable"      # energy 4, comfort 3
    # These become active searches and dialogue topics
    
  # LONG-TERM ASPIRATIONS (persistent drives)
  aspirations:
    - goal: "Return treasure to Mother"
      progress: 80%   # Almost there!
      # Drives major decisions and narrative arc
      
    - goal: "Map the entire maze"
      progress: 60%
      # Influences exploration choices
      
    - goal: "Avenge the skeleton"
      progress: 100%  # DONE! Satisfaction boost
      completed: true
      
  # MEMORIES (affect mood and decisions)
  recent_memories:
    - event: "Slayed the grue with blue cheese"
      mood_effect: +2 proud, +1 confident
      narrative: "Still can't believe that worked"
      
    - event: "Found skeleton's memorial coin"
      mood_effect: +1 serious, -1 cheerful
      narrative: "Someone died here. Could have been me."
      
  # RELATIONSHIPS (affect social interactions)
  relationships:
    mother:
      closeness: 9
      # High closeness = guilt about broken promises
      
    bartender:
      closeness: 4
      trust: 6
      # Will share secrets, buy drinks
      
    grue:
      closeness: 0
      status: "defeated"
      # Source of pride narratives
```

**How YAML Jazz Comments Drive Narrative:**

The comments aren't just documentation — the LLM reads them!

```yaml
hunger: 3         # Getting peckish... food ads score higher
```

This comment tells the LLM:
- Character should mention being hungry in dialogue
- Food-related advertisements get scoring bonus
- Kitchen becomes more attractive destination
- Eating actions become more likely

### Dynamic Self-Assessment

Entities can Mind-Scope themselves:
- Compare current state to ideal
- Track growth over time
- Identify rigid patterns
- Watch needs fluctuate and understand why

### Vocabulary Toggle

Switch between `PLAIN-TALK` and `SHRINK-RAP` modes for descriptions and dialogues.

### Image Generation Rule

**When generating images of characters, ALWAYS include Mind Mirror as metadata.**

```yaml
image_prompt:
  subject: "Captain Ashford"
  action: "triumphantly holding the Golden Chalice"
  
  character_state:
    mind_mirror:
      confident: 6
      cheerful: 5
      proud: 5
      creative: 6
    costume: "Space pirate with holographic eyepatch"
    mood: "victorious, exhausted, relieved"
    location: "Treasure Chamber, warm golden light"
    
  style: "dramatic portrait, heroic lighting"
```

**Why this matters:**
- Ensures character coherence across multiple images
- Enables regeneration with same personality
- Connects visual to psychological
- Personality affects posture, expression, energy
- Metadata travels with image for context

## The Important Disclaimer

From the original software:

> *"In this program you will find references and statements attributed to several hundred public figures and historical personages. All such statements attributed to living persons are fictional; they are intended as gentle satire and provocative humor. In no case is there any implication that the statements reflect the true sentiments of the 'alleged' speaker."*

This aligns perfectly with MOOLLM's [representation-ethics](../representation-ethics/) framework: activate traditions, don't impersonate.

---

## Theme Song

> *You can be anyone this time around*
> *You can be anything this time around*
> *It encourages me to change, to improve, to grow*
> *You can be anything this time around*
