> *"Mirrors should reflect a little before throwing back images."* — Jean Cocteau

> *"The ultimate intimacy is where you show them your personal database — you show your Mind Mirror."* — Timothy Leary

## What It Is

**Mind Mirror** (1985) was Timothy Leary's software for digitizing consciousness. Published by Electronic Arts when EA made weird beautiful things, it brought academic psychology to personal computers decades before modern personality apps.

This skill brings that system into MOOLLM as a framework for modeling characters, NPCs, and exploring personality dynamics.

## The Origin Story

In 1950, Timothy Leary completed his PhD dissertation at UC Berkeley: *"The Social Dimensions of Personality: Group Process and Structure."* This pioneering work developed the **Interpersonal Circumplex** — a geometric model mapping all human personality on two axes:

```
                    DOMINANCE
                        ↑
                        |
          Arrogant   ───┼───   Confident
                        |
    HOSTILITY ←─────────┼─────────→ AFFILIATION
                        |
          Timid      ───┼───   Docile
                        |
                        ↓
                   SUBMISSION
```

Thirty-five years later, Leary collaborated with programmers Peter Van den Beemt and Bob Dietz to transform this academic work into interactive software.

## The Prison Escape: Ultimate Validation

In 1970, Leary was given psychological tests upon prison intake — including the **Leary Interpersonal Behavior Inventory**, a test he himself had designed.

Understanding exactly what it measured, Leary answered strategically:
- Appeared mild-mannered, conforming
- Showed interest in forestry and gardening
- Displayed no leadership tendencies
- Expressed respect for authority

**Result:** Classified minimum security. Assigned outdoor work detail. Escaped by climbing a tree near the perimeter fence and shimmying along a telephone cable over the razor wire.

**The lesson:** Understanding how you're measured gives you power. Consciousness of systems enables transcendence.

## Leary's Philosophy

### The Mirror Metaphor

> *"Remember the title — it's a mirror. Now a best friend is your mirror because your mirror doesn't say 'well you bad boy get a haircut' or the mirror doesn't say 'hey turkey fix your tie' — you have to decide that. It's your own mind and we all have these thoughts in our mind made up of these complicated little, you know, Erector Set structures."*

### Consciousness as Software

> *"This software program allows you to digitalize your thoughts."*

The brain is a biocomputer. Consciousness is its software. Just as software can be debugged and upgraded, so can the mind.

### The PC is the LSD of the 1990s

> *"I turned on that Apple computer, and it was like taking psychedelics all over again. The screen lit up, I could control what appeared, I could create realities, store them, share them. I realized this was the tool we'd been looking for — a consciousness-expanding technology that was legal, accessible, and infinitely programmable."*

**Evolution:**
- **1960s:** Turn on, tune in, drop out (consciousness via chemistry)
- **1980s:** Turn on, boot up, jack in (consciousness via computers)

### The Ultimate Intimacy

> *"The ultimate intimacy is... you can love them, you can sleep with them, safe sex of course, and then you can even get married. But the real intimacy is where you show them your personal database — you show your Mind Mirror."*

### Generational Power

> *"You're the first generation in human history to know how to control your own nervous system, change your own reality. Tune in and take over! Blow your own mind, make up your own mind."*

## Bob Dietz on the Development

Bob Dietz, co-creator, on working with Leary:

> *"His vision was way out there in the future so a lot of what we had to do was kind of pull it back a little bit and say well, this machine can't do all that. He always had these kind of big vision things of wanting to do three-dimensionally and you know have the computer react to everything you said and with artificial intelligence."*

On Leary's goals:

> *"He was all about self-empowerment, giving the users the keys to the kingdom."*

On the internet vision:

> *"I cannot begin to tell you how much Timothy Leary would have embraced and loved the notion of seeing Mind Mirror applied on the internet."*

## In MOOLLM: The Living Personality System

Mind Mirror becomes dynamic infrastructure for characters and entities.

### Character DNA

Every MOOLLM entity can have a Mind Mirror profile defining its personality:

```yaml
character:
  name: "Captain Ashford"
  mind_mirror:
    bio_energy:
      energetic: 6
      cheerful: 5
      restless: 4
    emotional_insight:
      confident: 6
      friendly: 5
    mental_abilities:
      creative: 6
      innovative: 5
    social_interaction:
      uninhibited: 5
      worldly: 4
```

### Soul-Chat Voice Calibration

Mind Mirror dimensions influence how characters speak:
- High **assertiveness** → direct statements
- High **creativity** → metaphors and tangents
- High **cheerful** → upbeat tone

### Dynamic Self-Assessment

Entities can Mind-Scope themselves:
- Compare current state to ideal
- Track growth over time
- Identify rigid patterns

### Vocabulary Toggle

Switch between `PLAIN-TALK` and `SHRINK-RAP` modes for descriptions and dialogues.

## The Important Disclaimer

From the original software:

> *"In this program you will find references and statements attributed to several hundred public figures and historical personages. All such statements attributed to living persons are fictional; they are intended as gentle satire and provocative humor. In no case is there any implication that the statements reflect the true sentiments of the 'alleged' speaker."*

This aligns perfectly with MOOLLM's [representation-ethics](../representation-ethics/) framework: activate traditions, don't impersonate.

## Theme Song

> *You can be anyone this time around*
> *You can be anything this time around*
> *It encourages me to change, to improve, to grow*
> *You can be anything this time around*
