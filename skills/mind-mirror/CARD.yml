# THE MODEL

model:
  timothy-leary: |
    Timothy Leary (1985) developed the Interpersonal
    Circumplex: a 2D model of personality based on
    dominance (vertical) and affiliation (horizontal).
    
  four-planes: |
    - EMOTIONAL: How do I feel? (passionate ↔ detached)
    - INTELLECTUAL: How do I think? (curious ↔ certain)
    - PHYSICAL: How do I act? (active ↔ passive)
    - SOCIAL: How do I relate? (open ↔ guarded)
    
  complement-to-sims: |
    Sims traits (nice, outgoing, active, playful, neat)
    capture behavior. Mind Mirror captures motivation.
    Together: complete personality picture.
