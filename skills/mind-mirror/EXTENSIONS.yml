  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  # The LLM reads these comments and uses them for:
  # - Internal monologue generation
  # - Dialogue about feelings ("I'm starving...")
  # - Decision priorities (low hunger → seek food)
  # - Advertisement scoring (food +20 when hungry)
  # - Realistic character simulation
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  # WANTS (short-term desires, emerge from low needs)
  # These drive dialogue and immediate goals
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  # - "Find something to eat"       # from hunger < 4

  # - "Talk to someone"             # from social < 4
  # - "Do something fun!"           # from fun < 3
