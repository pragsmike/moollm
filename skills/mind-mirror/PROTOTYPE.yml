    vertical_axis:
      name: "POWER"
      positive: "Dominance (taking charge, leading, controlling)"
      negative: "Submission (following, deferring, yielding)"
    horizontal_axis:
      name: "AFFILIATION"
      positive: "Love (supporting, accepting, nurturing)"
      negative: "Hostility (opposing, rejecting, attacking)"
    insight: |
      By arranging these as perpendicular axes, Leary created a circular
      space where every interpersonal behavior has a location.

# LEARY'S DIRECT QUOTES

leary_quotes:
  
  introduction: |
    "Hello, I'm Timothy Leary, welcome to Mind Mirror. For about two years
    I've been working on this software program. It's called Mind Mirror.
    It allows you to digitalize your thoughts."
    
  on_academic_foundation: |
    "This is based upon my PhD thesis when I was a psychologist at
    the University of California in 1950. In those days I learned
    how to digitalize thoughts about yourself and how you'd like
    to be and your mother and your father."
    
  on_the_technique: |
    "It's basically a technique you take your own stereotypes of self
    or whatever it can be and see it on the screen and then you can
    massage that thought, you can change it. How would I like to be?
    How was I when I was a child? How would I be if I was a woman?
    You get the picture - suddenly you're freed from this heavy
    concept of self."
    
  on_appliance_concept: |
    "I like the word Appliance because an appliance is something that
    you use at home and it's for your own personal comfort or your
    personal entertainment or your personal education."
    
  on_thought_laundering: |
    "With the wonders of the personal computer, yeah, you can pop
    your thoughts in your tired old concept, wash them and dry them
    and pull them around, and you can see my thoughts. I think make
    us smarter and happier and hopefully funnier."
    
  on_mirror_philosophy: |
    "Remember the title - it's a mirror. Now a best friend is your
    mirror because your mirror doesn't say 'well you bad boy get a
    haircut' or the mirror doesn't say 'hey turkey fix your tie' -
    you have to decide that. It's your own mind and we all have
    these thoughts in our mind made up of these complicated little,
    you know, Erector Set structures."
    
  on_intimacy: |
    "The ultimate intimacy is... you can love them, you can sleep
    with them, safe sex of course, and then you can even get married.
    But the real intimacy is where you show them your personal
    database - you show your Mind Mirror."
    
  on_his_product: |
    "I love my product. You know what my product is? The human
    mind and human hope and human enthusiasm."
    
  on_generational_power: |
    "You're the first generation in human history to know how to
    control your own nervous system, change your own reality.
    Tune in and take over! Blow your own mind, make up your own mind."
    
  on_life_simulations: |
    "There are 3,200 micro events from anyone's life. You're in
    the womb, your first day of school, you're playing all these
    roles. It allows you turning thoughts around so you can do
    all these things."
    
  on_resistance: |
    "Maybe people don't want to know how they're thinking. Maybe
    they want a mind mirror - you want to really see what's on
    your mind? Get out of here! Or you want to show me what's
    on your mind? Your boot up Mind Mirror and let's get some
    of your thought."

# BOB DIETZ'S RECOLLECTIONS

dietz_quotes:
  
  on_development: |
    "It's been nearly 25 years since my dear friend Timothy Leary
    and I sat down with a couple of programmers and started outlining
    what was to become one of the very first software computer games
    called Mind Mirror. He called it a mental application because it
    is used to help people reflect upon their world more intelligently."
    
  on_learys_vision: |
    "His vision was way out there in the future so a lot of what we
    had to do was kind of pull it back a little bit and say well,
    this machine can't do all that. He always had these kind of big
    vision things of wanting to do three-dimensionally and you know
    have the computer react to everything you said and with artificial
    intelligence."
    
  on_psychometrics: |
    "The psychological work he did he referred to as psychometrics
    which was quantizing psychological characteristics."
    
  on_social_networking: |
    "In this game Mind Mirror, it wasn't just one person playing
    against another or one person playing against the game - he
    saw it as very much a social networking tool."
    
  on_internet_vision: |
    "Timothy was a very early advocate of the internet before it
    was even called the internet. He recognized that this was
    going to have a great impact on society."
    
  on_empowerment: |
    "He was all about self-empowerment, giving the users the
    keys to the kingdom."
    
  on_learys_internet_dream: |
    "I cannot begin to tell you how much Timothy Leary would
    have embraced and loved the notion of seeing Mind Mirror
    applied on the internet."
    
  on_people_power: |
    "What's happening now is that the power is coming into the
    hands of the people, which was totally his thing."

# PRISON ESCAPE STORY

prison_escape:
  date: "September 12, 1970"
  location: "California Men's Colony-West, San Luis Obispo"
  
  background: |
    Sentenced to 20 years for marijuana possession, Leary was given
    psychological tests upon intake — including the Leary Interpersonal
    Behavior Inventory, a test he himself had designed.
    
  strategy: |
    Understanding exactly what the test measured, Leary answered to
    create the profile of a mild-mannered, conforming individual with
    interest in forestry, no leadership tendencies, and respect for
    authority.
    
  result: |
    Classified as minimum security risk. Assigned to outdoor work
    detail with minimal supervision. Escaped by climbing a tree near
    the perimeter fence and shimmying along a telephone cable over
    the razor wire.
    
  lesson: |
    Understanding how you're measured gives you power.
    Consciousness of systems enables transcendence.

  to several hundred public figures and historical personages. All
  such statements attributed to living persons are fictional; they

# THEME SONG

  lyrics: |
    You can be anyone this time around

# THE PC IS THE LSD OF THE 1990s

digital_consciousness:
  
  leary_insight: |
    "I turned on that Apple computer, and it was like taking
    psychedelics all over again. The screen lit up, I could
    control what appeared, I could create realities, store
    them, share them. I realized this was the tool we'd been
    looking for — a consciousness-expanding technology that
    was legal, accessible, and infinitely programmable."
    
  evolution:
    1960s: "Turn on, tune in, drop out (consciousness via chemistry)"
    1980s: "Turn on, boot up, jack in (consciousness via computers)"
    
  parallels:
    - "Both showed reality was programmable"
    - "Both challenged authority and centralized control"
    - "Both empowered individual consciousness exploration"

# HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE

significance:
  firsts:
    - "First major software to bridge academic psychology with personal computing"
    - "Preceded Myers-Briggs computerization by years"
    - "Pioneered gamification of psychology"
    - "Demonstrated viability of psychological software"
    - "Proved consciousness could be made interactive"
    
  influence:
    - "Visual personality mapping → modern data visualization"
    - "Gamified self-assessment → app-based psychology"
    - "Comparative analysis → personality matching algorithms"
    - "Interactive scenarios → serious games"

# YAML JAZZ FOR SIMULATION

yaml_jazz_simulation: |
  Comments in Mind Mirror configs DRIVE the simulation:
  
  ```yaml
  hunger: 3         # Getting peckish... food ads score higher
  energy: 4         # Tired but pushing through — may make mistakes
  fun: 2            # BORED. Will seek entertainment. Even risky entertainment.
  proud: 6          # Won't ask for help even when should
  ```
  
  The LLM reads these comments and:
  1. Incorporates them into dialogue
  2. Adjusts advertisement scoring
  3. Influences autonomous decisions
  4. Shapes narrative tone
  
  This is YAML Jazz applied to character simulation.

# PHILOSOPHICAL QUOTES

quotes:
  
  jean_cocteau: |
    "Mirrors should reflect a little before throwing back images."
    
  oliver_wendell_holmes: |
    "In a magic mirror we see reflected not only our lives, but the
    lives of all men that have been. When I think on this majestic
    theme, my eyes dazzle."
