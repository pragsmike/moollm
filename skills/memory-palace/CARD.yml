# THE ANCIENT TECHNIQUE

technique:
  origin: |
    Ancient Greek/Roman orators memorized speeches by
    imagining walking through a familiar building,
    placing key points in each room.
    
  why_it_works: |
    Spatial memory is powerful. We easily remember
    where things are in physical space. The palace
    technique hijacks this for abstract knowledge.
    
  moollm_application: |
    Directories ARE rooms.
    Files ARE objects in rooms.
    Navigation IS remembering.
    The filesystem is already a memory palace.
