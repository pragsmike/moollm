# Memory Palace

> *"The filesystem is the mind. Directories are rooms. Files are objects."*

The ancient method of loci, adapted for LLMs.

> [!TIP]
> **Place knowledge in locations. Navigate to remember.** The filesystem IS your memory palace.

## The Technique

Place knowledge in **locations**. Navigate to **remember**.

```mermaid
graph TD
    E[🚪 Entrance] --> W[🌳 West Wing]
    E --> N[⭐ North Tower]
    E --> S[📚 South Library]
    
    W --> WR1[yaml-jazz/]
    W --> WR2[bpip/]
    
    N --> NR1[gardener/]
    N --> NR2[archivist/]
    
    S --> SR1[protocols/]
    S --> SR2[examples/]
```

Each room contains:
- **Objects** (files) — artifacts to examine
- **Exits** (links) — doors to other rooms
- **Atmosphere** — the room's essence

---

## This IS the Room Skill

Memory Palace and [Room](../room/) are deeply connected:

| Memory Palace | Room Skill |
|---------------|------------|
| Location | Directory |
| Object | File |
| Traversal | Enter/Exit |
| Placement | Create file |
| Recall | Navigate to |

**Memory Palace** = Room + spatial mnemonic intent

## Placing Knowledge

To remember something:

1. **Choose a room** — where does this belong?
2. **Create a file** — the object to place
3. **Link it** — connect to related objects
4. **Walk there** — navigate to reinforce

```yaml
# palace/concepts/yaml-jazz/ROOM.yml
room:
  name: "YAML Jazz Chamber"
  contains:
    - "jazz-principles.md"    # Core ideas
    - "examples/"             # Sub-room of examples
  exits:
    parent: "../"
    related: "../play-learn-lift/"
  atmosphere: "improvisational, semantic"
```

## The Intertwingularity

Memory Palace is Room with **mnemonic intent**.

```mermaid

    MP[🏛️ memory-palace] -->|IS-A| R[🚪 room]
    MP -->|narrative variant| AP[⚔️ adventure]
    MP -->|objects are| TC[🎴 trading-card]
    MP -->|rooms speak| SC[💬 soul-chat]
    
    R -->|+ mnemonic intent| MP
    AP -->|+ quest framing| R
```
