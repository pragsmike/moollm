    Independent assessment of committee output against a rubric.
    Evaluator has no debate context — can't be gamed.
    
    If scores are poor, critique goes back to committee for revision.

# THE ADVERSARIAL LOOP

adversarial-loop:
  why: |
    Committee members know they'll be scored but can't see
    evaluator's reasoning. This prevents gaming metrics.
    
  flow: |
    Committee produces → Evaluator scores →
    If poor: critique back → Committee revises →
    Until approved or abandoned
