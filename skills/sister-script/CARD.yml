# THE METHODOLOGY

methodology:
  flow:
    1: "Write procedure as PROCEDURE.md"
    2: "LLM follows it (PLAY/LEARN)"
    3: "Refine until stable"
    4: "Extract to Python (LIFT)"
    5: "Keep doc as source of truth"
    
  why: |
    Documentation is readable by everyone.
    Scripts are only readable by programmers.
    The doc comes first, stays authoritative.
