    Document-first automation with a twist: the Python script IS the doc.
    
    Structure your scripts so both humans AND LLMs can understand them:
    - Imports reveal dependencies
    - Globals/enums reveal state
    - CLI definition reveals the API (with help text)
    - Implementation follows (can be skimmed)
    
    Single source of truth. DRY. Works for users AND LLMs.

# TOOLS REQUIRED

tools:
  required:
    - read_file
    - write_file
  optional:
    - run_terminal_cmd

tier: 2  # May execute scripts

# THE SCRIPT STRUCTURE PATTERN

script-structure:
  
  principle: |
    Structure Python scripts so the TOP of the file tells you everything
    you need to know about WHAT it does. The BOTTOM has HOW.
    
    Users run: `cli.py --help` or `cli.py command --help`
    LLMs read: Just the first ~100 lines to understand the full API
    
  canonical-order:
    1-imports: |
      """Script docstring — what this does."""
      
      import sys
      import argparse
      from pathlib import Path
      from typing import Optional
      import yaml  # etc.
      
      # Dependencies are immediately visible
      # LLM knows what's available
      
    2-globals-and-enums: |
      # CONFIGURATION
      DEFAULT-CONFIG-PATH = Path("~/.config/moollm/config.yml")
      VERSION = "1.0.0"
      
      # ENUMS / CONSTANTS
      class Mode(Enum):
          PLAY = "play"
          LEARN = "learn"
          LIFT = "lift"
          
      # STATE SHAPE
      @dataclass
      class AppState:
          current-room: Path
          inventory: list[str]
          turn: int = 0
          
      # Now LLM knows the state shape
      
    3-cli-definition: |
      # CLI DEFINITION — This IS the API documentation
      
      def create-parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser:
          parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
              description="MOOLLM Sister Script CLI",
              epilog="See 'cli.py COMMAND --help' for command details."
          )
          subparsers = parser.add-subparsers(dest="command")
          
          # LOOK command
          look-parser = subparsers.add-parser(
              "look",
              help="Describe the current room",
              description="Read ROOM.yml and display contents."
          )
          look-parser.add-argument(
              "--verbose", "-v",
              action="store-true",
              help="Show all room details"
          )
          
          # GO command  
          go-parser = subparsers.add-parser(
              "go",
              help="Move to another room",
              description="Navigate through an exit to adjacent room."
          )
          go-parser.add-argument(
              "direction",
              help="Direction to go (north, south, etc.)"
          )
          
          return parser
          
      # LLM now knows the FULL API without reading implementation
      
    4-implementation: |
      # IMPLEMENTATION — Can be skimmed or skipped initially
      
      def cmd-look(args, state):
          """Implementation of LOOK command."""
          room = load-room(state.current-room)
          # ... actual logic ...
          
      def cmd-go(args, state):
          """Implementation of GO command."""
          # ... actual logic ...
          
      def main():
          parser = create-parser()
          args = parser.parse-args()
          state = load-state()
          
          commands = {
              "look": cmd-look,
              "go": cmd-go,
          }
          
          if args.command in commands:
              commands[args.command](args, state)
              
      if --name-- == "--main--":
          main()

  benefits:
    for-humans: |
      - `cli.py --help` shows all commands
      - `cli.py go --help` shows command details
      - Standard CLI conventions
      - Self-documenting
      
    for-llms: |
      - Read top of file → know everything
      - Imports → know dependencies
      - Globals → know state shape
      - CLI definition → know full API with types
      - Don't need to read implementation to use it
      - CAN read implementation to enhance it
      
    for-both: |
      - Single source of truth (no doc drift)
      - DRY — help text IS documentation
      - Changes to CLI auto-update --help
      - Types and defaults visible

      command: "New command to add"
    output: state-change + chat
    effect: "Add CLI parser + implementation, maintaining structure"
    invoked-by: [player]

# STATE

state:
  known-scripts: []
  script-apis: {}  # Cached API understanding

# THE METHODOLOGY

methodology:
  flow:
    1: "Write procedure as PROCEDURE.md"
    2: "LLM follows it (PLAY/LEARN)"
    3: "Refine until stable"
    4: "Extract to Python CLI (LIFT) using canonical structure"
    5: "Script IS the doc — single source of truth"
    
  why: |
    Documentation drifts. Code is truth.
    
    But code is hard to read! Unless...
    You structure it so the TOP is the documentation:
    - Imports = dependencies
    - Globals = state
    - CLI = API with help text
    - Implementation = details (read later)
    
    Now the script serves BOTH audiences:
    - Humans: run --help
    - LLMs: read top of file
    
  cli-module-choice:
    argparse:
      pros: "stdlib, no dependencies, widely understood"
      cons: "verbose, less pretty output"
      when: "Simple CLIs, minimal dependencies"
      
    click:
      pros: "decorator syntax, pretty help, easy subcommands"
      cons: "dependency, magic decorators"
      when: "Complex CLIs, user-facing tools"
      
    typer:
      pros: "type hints as API, minimal code"
      cons: "dependency, less explicit"
      when: "Rapid development, type-hint fans"
