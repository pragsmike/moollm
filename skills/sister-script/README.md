## Overview

The document is the source of truth. Scripts are its children. This is the **LIFT stage** of [play-learn-lift](../play-learn-lift/).

## The Pattern

```
📄 Document → 💻 Commands → 📋 Procedure → 🤖 Sister Script
```

1. Start with natural language (PLAY)
2. Add manual commands (PLAY/LEARN)
3. Document working procedures (LEARN)
4. Generate automation (LIFT)

## Bidirectional Evolution

- Document → Script: Proven procedures become automated
- Script → Document: Automation insights improve docs
