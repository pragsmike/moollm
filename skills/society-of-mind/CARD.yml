description: |
  Implements Minsky's Society of Mind theory within MOOLLM.
  Intelligence emerges from the interaction of many simple agents.
  Skills are agents. Characters are societies. Behavior is emergent.
  No single agent understands; understanding emerges from the pattern.

# Rubrics
rubrics:
  agent_minimality:
    description: "Agents should do one thing"
    criteria:
      - single clear function
      - limited scope of knowledge
      - simple activation conditions
      
  emergent_behavior:
    description: "Agency behavior emerges from agent competition"
    criteria:
      - no single agent controls
      - behavior from interaction pattern
      - suppressed agents remain active (but quiet)
      
  competition_dynamics:
    description: "Conflict resolution is explicit"
    criteria:
      - strengths measured from context
      - winner activates, loser suppresses
      - suppressed agent grows stronger

# Examples
examples:
  character_inner_debate:
    description: "Palm debates whether to share his essay"
    agents: [creative, fear, social, perfectionist]
    resolution: "creative + social > fear + perfectionist"
    action: "Palm shares with Don"
    
  multi_agent_call:
    description: "LLM simulates inner society"
    prompt_pattern: |
      SITUATION: [context]
      AGENT_1: [speaks]
      AGENT_2: [speaks]
      AGENT_3: [speaks]
      Show debate. Character decides.
      
  sims_autonomy:
    description: "Action selection via motive scoring"
    algorithm: "for each action: score = sum(motive * effect)"
    winner: "highest scoring action"

  understanding emergent behavior,
  or building systems where intelligence emerges
  from the interaction of simpler parts.
