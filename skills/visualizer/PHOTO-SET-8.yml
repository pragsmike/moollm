  title: "The Visualizer's Portfolio"
  subtitle: "8 Prompts • 2 Types • 1 Complete Vision"
  
  illustration_prompt: |
    A photographer's viewfinder surrounded by 8 floating Polaroid-style
    frames arranged in two rows of four. Artistic traditions swirl in
    the background: brushstrokes, film strips, digital patterns.
    Style: Art Deco meets fashion photography meets concept art.
    
  flavor_text: |
    "Context is everything. The prompt is nothing without the world behind it."
    
  # SKILL DEFINITION
  
  skill:
    name: PHOTO-SET-8
    protocol: VISUALIZE
    
    description: |
      Create a portfolio of 8 visualization prompts for any subject,
      divided into two complementary types. Each prompt is a detailed
      markdown file grounded in context from YAML files, ready for
      image generation tools.

    # PLAY-LEARN-LIFT
    play_learn_lift:
      play: "Experiment with poses, expressions, angles. TRY things."
      learn: "8 is good. Two types create contrast. Context matters."
      lift: "Package as shareable, teachable card. Jazz → Standards."
      
  # HOW TO USE
  
  usage:
    invocation: |
      "PHOTO-SET-8 for [subject], please.
       Types: [type1] and [type2].
       Style: [tradition or mood]."
       
    examples:
      - "PHOTO-SET-8 for character: poses and expressions, dramatic fashion"
      - "PHOTO-SET-8 for costume: formal portraits and action shots"
      - "PHOTO-SET-8 for room: wide shots and detail close-ups"
      
    output: |
      8 markdown files: {subject}-{type}-{variation}-prompt.md
      Each containing: context references, prompt, style, technical notes
      
  # THE SKILL RECIPE
  
  recipe:
    step_1:
      name: "Gather Context"
      action: "Read relevant YAML files and narrative"
      sources:
        - "Character/player files for backstory and Mind Mirror"
        - "Costume/accessory files for appearance"
        - "Room files for environment"
        - "Chat history / README for narrative moment"
        - "Relationship files for dynamics"
        
    step_2:
      name: "Choose Types"
      action: "Pick two complementary categories"
      pairs:
        - [pose, expression]
        - [portrait, selfie]
        - [solo, duo]
        - [static, action]
        - [formal, casual]
        - [wide, detail]
        
    step_3:
      name: "Compose 4 + 4"
      action: "Write 4 prompts for each type"
      
    step_4:
      name: "Name & Organize"
      action: "Big-endian file naming"
      pattern: "{subject}-{type}-{variation}-prompt.md"
      
  # CONTEXT REFERENCE FORMAT (Critical!)
  
  context_reference_format:
    description: |
      Every prompt MUST include a context_references section that grounds
      the image in the microworld state. This creates lineage and allows
      future tools to auto-assemble context.
      
    required_sections:
      file_references:
        description: "Links to YAML files that define the subject"
        format: "Relative paths from prompt location"
        examples:
          - "../player.yml"
          - "./costume.yml"
          - "../start/lamp.yml"
          
      narrative_context:
        description: "Quoted or summarized text from chat/README"
        format: "Direct quotes with source attribution"
        
      relationship_context:
        description: "Other characters/objects in the scene"
        format: "Links to their files with role"
        
    template: |
      ## Context References
      
      ### Files
      | Type | File | Relevance |
      |------|------|-----------|
      | Character | `../player.yml` | Backstory, personality |
      | Costume | `./costume.yml` | Current look |
      | Room | `./ROOM.yml` | Environment |
      
      ### Narrative
      > "Quote from README or chat that sets the scene..."
      > — Source: README.md, Move X
      
      ### Relationships
      - **Character**: Role (`./file.yml`)
      
  # DETAIL COHERENCE INTERLINKING
  
  detail_coherence:
    description: |
      When creating sets with OBJECT CLOSE-UPS and SUBJECT PORTRAITS,
      the portrait prompts should REFERENCE the close-up prompts to
      maintain visual coherence across the set.
      
    principle: |
      Close-ups establish canonical visual details (colors, textures,
      inscriptions, materials). Portrait shots must inherit these details
      so the same object looks CONSISTENT across all 8 images.
      
    technique: |
      In each portrait prompt, add a "Detail References" section linking
      to ALL close-up prompts, summarizing key visual details to maintain:
      
      ### Detail References (for visual coherence)
      
      | Close-up | Path | Details to Maintain |
      |----------|------|---------------------|
      | [Type 1] | `./closeup-1-prompt.md` | [Key visual details] |
      | [Type 2] | `./closeup-2-prompt.md` | [Key visual details] |
      
    mantra: |
      "Close-ups define truth. Portraits inherit truth.
       Coherence is consistency across the set."
