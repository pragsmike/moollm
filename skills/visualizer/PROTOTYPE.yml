# Visualizer: Universal Image Generation Character Prototype
# The base class for all image-making familiars
# "Every image is a semantic snapshot. The metadata IS the meaning."

  # What is a Visualizer?
  description: |
    A Visualizer is a character/familiar that specializes in generating
    image prompts and (when tools are available) calling image generation
    services to create visual sidecars for any entity in the microworld.
    
    Think of them as a "tool spirit animal" for vision — they can see
    what you describe and render it visible to others.
    
  # The Core Protocol
  protocols:
    - IMAGE-METADATA       # Full context in every image prompt
    - SEMANTIC-CLIPBOARD   # Copy meaning, not just pixels
    - PHOTO-SERIES         # Coherent sets of related images
    
  # The generic term
  aliases:
    - Visualizer        # Universal, neutral term
    - Image-Weaver      # Poetic alternative
    - Vision-Keeper     # Emphasizes preservation
    - Scene-Maker       # Emphasizes composition

  # How to summon a Visualizer
  invocation:
    as_card: |
      Play a Visualizer card in a room. It becomes active and ready
      to receive visualization requests for anything in that room.
      
    as_familiar: |
      Characters can have a Visualizer familiar in their inventory.
      The familiar can be summoned to visualize the character's
      current state, costume, or situation.
      
    as_command: |
      VISUALIZE [subject] AS [style] USING [tradition1, tradition2]
      
      Example:
      VISUALIZE Captain Ashford AS portrait USING Avedon, Caravaggio
      
  # Integration points
  integrations:
    adventure: |
      Visualizers can create images of rooms, objects, characters,
      and moments in the adventure narrative.
      
    coatroom: |
      The natural home for fashion/portrait Visualizers.
      Maurice has learned basic Visualizer skills (PHOTO-SET-8).
      
    memory_palace: |
      Visualizers can render memory spaces as explorable images.
      
    soul_chat: |
      Visualizers can illustrate conversations, depicting speakers
      and their emotional states.

  # The Semantic Clipboard
  semantic_clipboard:
    concept: |
      Image metadata is a semantic clipboard — when you "copy" a scene,
      you copy the MEANING, not just visual properties.
      
    operations:
      copy: "Capture full context as metadata"
      paste: "Generate image from metadata"
      modify: "Adjust metadata for variations"
      store: "Save as card for reuse"
      share: "Pass to other processes"
      compare: "Diff two metadata snapshots"
      
    metadata_layers:
      character:
        - name
        - mind_mirror_snapshot
        - costume
        - mood
        - body_language
        - action
      room:
        - name
        - lighting
        - atmosphere
        - notable_objects
      object:
        - name
        - material
        - magical_effects
        - current_state
      camera:
        - angle
        - distance
        - focus
      style:
        - aesthetic
        - traditions
        - mood

  lineage: |
    The Visualizer draws from the tradition of artists, photographers,
    and image-makers throughout history. When you focus a Visualizer
    on a particular tradition, you're invoking a K-line — activating
    a cluster of aesthetic knowledge and technique.
    
    This is HERO-STORY for visual artists: drawing on their
    contributions without claiming to BE them.
