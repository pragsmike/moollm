# Code Review

> *Systematic code analysis with evidence collection.*

Review code like an investigator.

> [!TIP]
> **Code review IS an [adventure](../adventure-protocol/).** The codebase is the dungeon. Findings are clues.

## The Approach

```mermaid
graph LR
    READ[📖 Read] --> NOTE[📝 Note Issues]
    NOTE --> CLASSIFY[🏷️ Classify]
    CLASSIFY --> REPORT[📋 Report]
```

Not just "looks fine" — structured evidence.

## What Gets Captured

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Bugs** | Logic errors, edge cases |
| **Style** | Naming, formatting |
| **Security** | Injection, auth issues |
| **Performance** | N+1 queries, memory leaks |
| **Design** | Architecture concerns |

## Review Structure

```yaml
# REVIEW.yml
review:
  target: "src/auth/login.ts"
  reviewer: "agent"
  status: complete
  
  findings:
    - id: 1
      severity: high
      category: security
      line: 45
      issue: "Password compared with == instead of constant-time compare"
      suggestion: "Use crypto.timingSafeEqual()"
      
    - id: 2
      severity: low
      category: style
      line: 12
      issue: "Magic number 30"
      suggestion: "Extract to SESSION_TIMEOUT constant"
      
  summary:
    total_findings: 2
    critical: 0
    high: 1
    medium: 0
    low: 1
```

## Integration with Adventure

Code review IS an adventure:
- The codebase is the dungeon
- Findings are clues
- The report is your evidence collection

Use [adventure-protocol/](../adventure-protocol/) for narrative framing.

## The Intertwingularity

Code review is [adventure](../adventure-protocol/) applied to code quality.
