    Papert's insight: real learning happens by building things
    you can see, share, and modify. The filesystem is a
    microworld. Skills are constructions. You learn by doing.

# TOOLS REQUIRED

# METHODS

methods:
  
  BUILD:
    description: "Create something to learn by doing"
    parameters:
      concept: "What you want to understand"
      form: "What to build (skill, room, character, experiment)"
    output: chat (guidance) + files
    effect: "Guide construction that teaches the concept"
    invoked-by: [learner, teacher]
    
  INSPECT:
    description: "Examine how something works"
    parameters:
      thing: "What to inspect"
    output: chat (explanation)
    effect: "Reveal internals, explain mechanics"
    invoked-by: [learner]
    
  MODIFY:
    description: "Change something to see what happens"
    parameters:
      thing: "What to modify"
      change: "What to change"
    output: chat + state-change
    effect: "Make change, observe consequences"
    invoked-by: [learner]
    
  SHARE:
    description: "Show your construction to others"
    parameters:
      thing: "What to share"
      audience: "Who to share with"
    output: chat
    effect: "Explain your construction, get feedback"
    invoked-by: [learner]

# STATE

state: {}  # Pure philosophy, no persistent state

# THE PHILOSOPHY

philosophy:
  core-insight: |
    You can't learn to ride a bicycle by reading about it.
    You have to get on, fall down, and try again.
    
  papert-quote: |
    "The computer is the Proteus of machines. Its essence is its
    universality, its power to simulate. Because it can take on a
    thousand forms and can serve a thousand functions, it can
    appeal to a thousand tastes."
    
  moollm-application: |
    The filesystem is a microworld.
    Skills are constructions.
    YAML files are objects you can inspect and modify.
    You learn MOOLLM by building with MOOLLM.
