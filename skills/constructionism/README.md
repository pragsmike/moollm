# 🏗️ Constructionism

> *"If you can build it, you can understand it. If you can inspect it, you can trust it."*

**Full Spec:** [SKILL.md](SKILL.md)

## Overview

Seymour Papert's educational philosophy: learn by **building things** you can **inspect and modify**. MOOLLM is a microworld where the filesystem IS the learning environment.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Low Floor** | Easy to start, no setup |
| **High Ceiling** | Unlimited complexity |
| **Wide Walls** | Many paths to many goals |

## The Debug Cycle

```
Try → Inspect → Hypothesize → Modify → Understand
```

## Microworld Mapping

| Logo | MOOLLM |
|------|--------|
| Turtle | Character |
| Canvas | Room |
| Procedures | Skills |
| Variables | YAML |

## Cheating is Learning

> Open `character.yml` directly, add `magic_sword` to inventory — you've learned YAML!

The system rewards curiosity with knowledge.
