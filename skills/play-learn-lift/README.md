## Overview

The three-stage journey from curiosity to mastery to teaching. **This IS the MOOLLM methodology.**

## The Cycle

```
🎮 PLAY → 📚 LEARN → 🚀 LIFT → (inspire) → 🎮 PLAY
```

| Stage | Motto | What Happens |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **🎮 PLAY** | Jump in! | No prerequisites, curiosity drives discovery |
| **📚 LEARN** | Patterns emerge | Connections make sense, "I noticed..." |
| **🚀 LIFT** | Help others play | Teaching solidifies learning |

## Why This Matters

Most learning is backwards:
- ❌ Study first, then do
- ❌ Master before sharing

PLAY-LEARN-LIFT inverts it:
- ✅ **Do first**, understanding emerges
- ✅ **Share while learning**, teaching accelerates mastery
- ✅ **Mistakes are features**, not bugs
