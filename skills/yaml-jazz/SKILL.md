# YAML Jazz

> *"YAML is sheet music. The LLM is the jazz musician. Comments are soul."*

## What Is It?

**YAML Jazz** is how MOOLLM treats structured data: not as rigid schemas, but as **semantic improvisation** where:

- **Structure carries meaning** — indentation, ordering, grouping
- **Comments ARE data** — they're guidance, context, soul
- **The LLM interprets** — filling gaps, resolving ambiguity, inferring intent
- **Schemas are suggestions** — starting points, not prisons

```yaml
# This comment is NOT ignored!
# It tells the LLM: "be gentle with this section"
user_preferences:
  theme: dark    # they mentioned eye strain
  font_size: 16  # ← bump this if they complain again
```

---

## Core Principles

### Comments Matter

```yaml
# CRITICAL: Do not modify without user approval
api_key: ${SECRET}

# TODO: migrate to new format after v2 launch
legacy_format: true  # keeping for backwards compat
```

The LLM reads these. Acts on them. **Comments are instructions.**

### Structure Is Semantic

```yaml
# Priority by position (first = most important)
tasks:
  - Fix authentication bug     # P0
  - Update documentation       # P1  
  - Refactor old module        # P2
```

Order matters. Grouping matters. Proximity implies relationship.

### Improvise Within Constraints

Given incomplete data:

```yaml
user:
  name: Alice
  # preferences unknown
```

The LLM can improvise reasonable defaults while noting uncertainty:

```yaml
user:
  name: Alice
  preferences:        # inferred from context
    theme: light      # default, unconfirmed
    notifications: on # assumed
```

## The Jazz Metaphor

> *"Start with jazz, end with standards."*

| Jazz | YAML Jazz |
|------|-----------|
| Sheet music | Schema / template |
| Chord changes | Required fields |
| Improvisation | LLM interpretation |
| Soul | Comments |
| Ensemble | Multiple agents |
| Standards | Protocol conventions |

Like John Coltrane playing "My Favorite Things" — the structure is there, but every performance is unique, responsive, alive. 

The pun is deliberate: **jazz standards** are the classic songs every musician knows — and **software standards** are what you crystallize once patterns stabilize. Start improvising, end with reusable structures!

Character souls can sing their own favorite things in YAML Jazz!

And listen: **"YAML" sounds like jazz scat!** *yaml aml ding dong!* -- echoing The Edsels' doo-wop classic "Rama Lama Ding Dong" (1957). The name itself wants to be sung, improvised, riffed on. It's not an accident that this format became the soul carrier for LLM collaboration.

## When to Use

- **Configuration files** — comments explain why, not just what
- **State files** — annotations track history and intent  
- **Data exchange** — structured enough to parse, loose enough to extend
- **Human-LLM collaboration** — both can read and write it

---

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Rigid schema enforcement** — "field X is required" without context  
❌ **Stripping comments** — losing the soul  
❌ **Machine-only YAML** — if humans can't read it, use JSON  
❌ **Over-specification** — killing the jazz

## Dovetails With

### Sister Skills
- [postel/](../postel/) — Be liberal in accepting ambiguous YAML
- [soul-chat/](../soul-chat/) — Markdown with embedded YAML Jazz

### Kernel
- [kernel/constitution-core.md](../../kernel/constitution-core.md) — Section 3: YAML Jazz Principle
