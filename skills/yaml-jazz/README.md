# 🎷 YAML Jazz

> YAML is sheet music. The LLM is the jazz musician. Comments are soul.

## Overview

**YAML Jazz** is how MOOLLM treats structured data: not as rigid schemas, but as **semantic improvisation** where:

- **Structure carries meaning** — indentation, ordering, grouping
- **Comments ARE data** — they're guidance, context, soul
- **The LLM interprets** — filling gaps, resolving ambiguity
- **Schemas are suggestions** — starting points, not prisons

## Comments Matter

```yaml
# CRITICAL: Do not modify without user approval
api_key: ${SECRET}

hunger: 3  # Getting peckish. Is that pie?
           # ← This comment IS the character's inner voice
```

The LLM reads these. Acts on them. **Comments are instructions.**

## Core Principle

> No decorative `----` or `====` line comments — they waste tokens!

This is a **kernel-level directive**.
