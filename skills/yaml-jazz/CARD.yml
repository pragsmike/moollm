  description: |
    Semantic YAML where comments are first-class data.
    The LLM reads and interprets comments. Structure is
    for humans AND machines AND LLMs.

principles:
  comments-matter: "# Comments are semantic data for the LLM"
  structure-guides: "Hierarchy implies relationship"
  flexibility: "Accept variations, emit consistency (Postel)"
  human-readable: "Optimize for understanding, not parsing"
  entropy-preservation: "YAML preserves generation entropy; JSON causes collapse"

# Empirical validation: Sunil Kumar (Groundlight AI, 2025) found that
# switching from JSON to YAML for tool calling "massively improved
# generation entropy stability" during GRPO training. JSON's strict
# syntax constrains the model's ability to search and reason.

example: |
  # A character's inner conflict
  # The LLM reads this and understands the dramatic tension
  conflict:
    surface: "Wants to be brave"
    hidden: "Terrified of failure"
    # The tension between these drives the story
