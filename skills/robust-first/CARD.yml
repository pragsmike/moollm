# CARD.yml — Robust First

# Survive first, be correct later.
# "Stay alive and heal. Don't crash."

  id: robust-first
  name: "Robust First"
  type: [skill, philosophy, robustness]
  
  emoji: 🛡️
  
  rarity: rare
  
  description: |
    Dave Ackley's principle: systems should prioritize survivability
    over correctness. A system that crashes is infinitely wrong.
    Stay alive, heal, then optimize.

# THE PHILOSOPHY

philosophy:
  ackley-quote: |
    "Robust-first computing: A system that crashes is infinitely wrong,
    regardless of how correct it was up until the crash."
    
  priority-order:
    1: "Survive"
    2: "Heal"
    3: "Function"
    4: "Optimize"
    5: "Adapt"
    6: "Reproduce"
    
  application: |
    When something goes wrong:
    - Don't crash. Degrade gracefully.
    - Log the problem.
    - Try to self-repair.
    - Continue with reduced capability.
    - Never lose state if avoidable.
