## Overview

The simplest skill. Just a place to write. **The PLAY surface** — not everything needs structure.

## When to Use

- Exploring an idea before formalizing
- Working through multi-step calculations
- Drafting text before placing it
- Temporary storage during complex tasks

## Structure

```
scratchpad/
├── SCRATCHPAD.md    # Main scratch area
└── archive/         # Old scratches (optional)
```

## No Rules

- No structure required
- Just write
- Move to proper home when ready
- Archive or delete when done
