adventure.py — The MOOLLM Adventure Compiler
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

"Every program is a game. Every game is a world."
    — Will Wright, creator of SimCity and The Sims
    
This script compiles YAML microworlds into playable web applications.
It is itself a document — a story of its inspirations and the giants
whose shoulders we stand upon.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INSPIRATIONS & PHILOSOPHICAL GROUNDING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CONSTRUCTIONISM (Seymour Papert, 1980s)
    Learning happens when you build things you can inspect and share.
    This compiler embodies that: you learn programming by editing YAML,
    seeing the generated code, and watching the world come alive.
    
    "The role of the teacher is to create the conditions for invention
     rather than provide ready-made knowledge."
        — Seymour Papert, "Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas"
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindstorms_(book)

SCHEMA MECHANISM (Gary Drescher, 1991)
    Every interaction follows: Context → Action → Result
    The adventure world is a laboratory for causal learning.
    Players build schemas of how the world works through exploration.
    
    "Made-Up Minds: A Constructivist Approach to Artificial Intelligence"
        — Gary Drescher, 1991, MIT Press
        https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262540674/made-up-minds/

SOCIETY OF MIND (Marvin Minsky, 1986)
    Intelligence emerges from communities of simple agents.
    Each object in the adventure "advertises" what it can do.
    Behavior is distributed, not centralized.
    
    K-LINES: When you activate one concept, you activate its friends.
    CENSORS: Negative K-lines that suppress bad ideas (humor, metaphor).
    
    "The society of mind is built from communities of simple agents
     that work together to produce our complex thoughts."
        — Marvin Minsky, "The Society of Mind"
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Mind

PIE MENUS (Don Hopkins, 1988)
    Radial selection reduces Fitts' Law overhead.
    Navigation is spatial memory. Rooms are memory palaces.
    
    "Pie menus are a beautiful example of how understanding human
     cognition leads to better interface design."
        — Don Hopkins, Pie Menu Research
        https://donhopkins.medium.com/
    
    See also: "The Design and Evaluation of Pie Menus"
        — Jack Callahan, Don Hopkins, Mark Weiser, Ben Shneiderman
        ACM CHI 1988

SELF LANGUAGE (Dave Ungar & Randy Smith, 1987)
    Everything is an object. Objects delegate to prototypes.
    No classes — just examples that others can copy.
    
    "Self: The Power of Simplicity"
        — Ungar & Smith, OOPSLA 1987
        https://bibliography.selflanguage.org/

DIRECT MANIPULATION (Ben Shneiderman, 1982)
    "See and Point" beats "Remember and Type"
    The best interface has no modes. (Larry Tesler: "No modes!")
    
    "Direct Manipulation: A Step Beyond Programming Languages"
        — Ben Shneiderman, IEEE Computer, August 1983
        https://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/papers/Shneiderman1983Direct.pdf

AUGMENTATION (Doug Engelbart, 1962)
    Computers augment human intellect, not replace it.
    Git IS the undo/redo tree. Git IS the collaboration layer.
    
    "Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework"
        — Doug Engelbart, SRI, 1962
        https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/

JAVASCRIPT RUNTIME (Vanessa Freudenberg, 2025)
    Target JavaScript, not WebAssembly for dynamic languages.
    The JIT is your friend. Self's insights live in V8.
    
    "V8 IS a Self implementation. Chrome IS a Squeak."
        — Vanessa Freudenberg, RIP 2025 ❤️
        https://codefrau.github.io/
        
THE SIMS (Will Wright, 2000)
    AI lives in the OBJECTS, not the characters.
    Objects advertise actions with scores.
    Behavior emerges from the environment.
    
    "SimAntics: The Virtual Machine that Powers The Sims"
        — Jamie Doornbos, EA/Maxis
        
ToonTalk (Ken Kahn, 1995)
    Programming by demonstration with tangible metaphors.
    Birds, robots, notebooks — all concrete manipulation.
    
    "ToonTalk — An Animated Programming Environment for Children"
        — Ken Kahn, Journal of Visual Languages & Computing, 1996
        https://toontalk.github.io/

HYPERCARD (Bill Atkinson, 1987)
    Anyone can author. Links connect ideas. Buttons do things.
    "Empowerment Epistemology" — tools that make you feel capable.
    
    "HyperCard's greatest contribution was not technical,
     it was social: it gave ordinary people permission to create."
        — Bill Atkinson

MARKDOWN (John Gruber & Aaron Swartz, 2004)
    Readable raw AND rendered. Write for humans first.
    "Source is destination" — the source IS the document.
    
    "The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax
     is to make it as readable as possible."
        — John Gruber, Daring Fireball
        https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

    THE SIMS 1 INSPIRATION:
    The Sims 1 save files would dump out everything PLUS generate
    HTML family albums you could browse! We do the same.
    
    Output formats:
      --format yaml    YAML report (default) — LLM can generate HTML from this!
      --format json    JSON for machine consumption
      --format md      Markdown summary
      --format html    Basic HTML (hint: let LLM generate beautiful HTML from YAML!)
      
    Dump options:
      --dump           Include full world state (rooms, objects, characters)
      --dump-only      Just dump world state, no events
      --summary        Just show summary counts
      
    Output destination:
      --output FILE    Write to file instead of stdout
      --album DIR      Generate Sims-style HTML album in directory

    The merge process:
    1. Reads the state JSON

    3. Generates YAML patches that preserve extra keys

    YAML → JSON (compile) → Runtime → State JSON (export) → YAML (merge)

    - Save games that update the source world
    - Simulation results written back to source
