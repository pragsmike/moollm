# working_set.yml — Current Context State
#
# What files are currently in the LLM's active context?
# 
# PURPOSE:
#   - Custom orchestrator: Reads this to know what to include in prompt
#   - Cursor driver: Advisory; Cursor manages context automatically
#   - Debugging: Snapshot of what the LLM "sees" right now
#
# USAGE:
#   - Orchestrator populates this before each call
#   - LLM can request additions/removals
#   - Like Self's dynamic deoptimization: reconstruct state on demand

# ORCHESTRATOR BEHAVIOR
#
# Custom orchestrator:
#   1. Read hot.yml to know what to load
#   2. Build prompt with files in priority order
#   3. Update this file with actual loaded content
#   4. After call, check if LLM requested changes
#   5. Update hot.yml/cold.yml based on usage
#
# Cursor driver:
#   - Cursor handles context automatically
#   - This file is ADVISORY only
#   - Useful for debugging: "what did it see?"
#   - Can be enabled for diagnostic purposes
#   - Like Self's deoptimization: reconstruct on demand
