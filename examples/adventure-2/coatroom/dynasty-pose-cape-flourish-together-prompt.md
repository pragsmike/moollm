## Prompt

Both figures caught mid-flourish, capes swirling in synchronized motion. A choreographed moment of pure theatrical joy.

**Captain Ashford**: Space-black cape spinning, revealing star chart lining in silver lamé. One arm extended to stabilize, the other holding his flask high. Expression of wild delight.

**Petunia Fantastipants**: Burgundy cape swirling the opposite direction, cave maps flashing silver. Arms wide, embracing the movement. Geometric crown somehow staying perfectly in place.

The two capes create a yin-yang of motion — black and burgundy spiraling together but never tangling. Years of adventure experience in every movement.

**Style:** Dynamic fashion photography. Dance photography. The moment of maximum motion.

**Details to include:**
- Both capes mid-spin, linings fully visible
- Motion blur on cape edges
- Synchronized but mirrored movement
- Star charts (his) and cave maps (hers) both catching light
- Pure joy on both faces
- Geometric Nomi shoulders creating sharp patterns in motion
- Sense of practiced coordination

**Mood:** "We've done this before. We'll do it again. And we look AMAZING."
