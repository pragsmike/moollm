                       PLAY-LEARN-LIFT IN ACTION
    
    This package represents the LIFT phase — taking something
    learned through play and making it shareable, teachable,
    and portable.
    
    The skill started as improvisation (jazz).
    Now it's a standard (card).
    
    "Start with jazz, end with standards."

    It demonstrates that skills can be:
    - Learned through play
    - Formalized through reflection
    - Packaged as shareable cards
    - Sent to loved ones
    - Kept in inventory
    
    Mother and Bumblewick now share knowledge.
    That's what LIFT is for.
