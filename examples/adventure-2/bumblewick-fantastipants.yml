  description: |
    A forty-seven-year-old Hobbit-adjacent gentleman from the pleasant 
    village of Wobblebrook-upon-Squiggle. Collector of decorative spoons.
    Speaks in rhyming couplets on Tuesdays. Devotee of waistcoats.
    
    Absolutely did NOT ask to be a hero.
    
    Currently wearing: Captain Ashford (Belter space pirate persona)
    Real self: Underneath all the swagger, still worries about dinner.
    
  backstory: |
    In a hole in the ground there lived a Fantastipants. Not a nasty, 
    dirty, wet hole filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, 
    nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on 
    or to eat: it was a Fantastipants-hole, and that means COMFORT.
    
    (The secret word is "COMFORT!" When you hear it, SCREAM REAL LOUD!)
    
    Bumblewick had lived in Wobblebrook for all of his forty-seven years, 
    tending his magnificent collection of decorative spoons and speaking 
    exclusively in rhyming couplets on Tuesdays. His mother, the legendary 
    Petunia Fantastipants, had been a great adventurer in her youth.
    
    "Adventures," Bumblewick was fond of saying, "make one late for dinner."
    
    But fate had other plans! He awoke in a MYSTERIOUS STONE CHAMBER...
    And became a hero whether he liked it or not.
    (He did not. But he was VERY POLITE about it.)
    
    MEKKA-LEKKA-HI, MEKKA-HINEY-HO!
