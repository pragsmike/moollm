*A Narrative Tour with Mother*

>
> "Start at the beginning," she says.

## 🌙 Dreams

*You turn to the last page first — the dream is still warm.*

### [The Dream of the Grue Slayer](../home/dream-card.yml)

"This one is new, Mother. The Dream Catcher gave it to me this morning."

The page glows faintly. A dream where the maze wasn't dark. Where the
grue played cards with the skeleton. Where you were everyone and everything
at once.

"You were the mycelium, Mother. In the dream. You were everything."

She takes your hand. Says nothing. The pie continues to cool.

"That's everything, Mother. Every song. Every letter. Every photo.

"I'm so proud of you."

"I know, Mother. I know."
