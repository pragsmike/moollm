    The darkness swallows you whole. But wait—
    
    A warm light. A sense of beginnings. The smell of slightly
    damp stone and narrative convenience.
    
    You awaken in the Chamber of Commencement. Your score has
    been reset to 0, but your inventory remains intact. The 
    universe is merciful, if slightly disappointed in you.
    
    "Well," mutters Bumblewick, checking his waistcoat for grue
    damage, "THAT was unpleasant. Mother will never hear of this."

    You are standing in a small chamber carved from living rock. The walls
    bear the scratched initials of adventurers past:
    
      "WC+DW '76"       — Will Crowther & Don Woods, the founders
      "SA '78"          — Scott Adams, who brought adventures home
      "XYZZY WAS HERE"  — A mystery, a magic word, a tradition
      
      "CA '26"          — Captain Ashford, Grue Slayer, First Penguin
      "(BF underneath)" — Bumblewick Fantastipants, the hero beneath the cape
    
    The newest carvings are fresh, cut with something sharp and pungent.
    They smell faintly of blue cheese.
    
    The chamber is suffused with a soft, sourceless glow — the kind of
    magical light that adventure games provide to starting areas so that
    heroes don't immediately die in the dark. How thoughtful.
    
    The brass lamp is gone from its shelf. You took it. You kept it lit.
    You upgraded it to Premium Blue. You earned that lamp.
    
    Three exits beckon, plus a stairway UP you hadn't noticed before:
    
    NORTH: A rough archway leading into the maze — now CONQUERED and MAPPED.
    
    WEST: The kitchen — where Mother's note waited, where promises were made.
    
    EAST: The coatroom — where Bumblewick became Captain Ashford.
    
    UP: A stairway leading to warm light and the smell of pie. Home.
    
    (Your score is 31. Your moves: 69. Your grues slain: 1. Your legend: BEGUN.)

        A rough archway carved through the rock. Beyond it, shadows pool
        like spilled ink. Your lamp's light doesn't quite reach whatever
        lies ahead. You have a bad feeling about this. The kind of feeling
        one gets before entering a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
        
        Someone has scratched "ABANDON HOPE" on the archway, then crossed
        it out and written "ACTUALLY IT'S NOT THAT BAD" underneath.
        
    west:
      destination: ../kitchen/
      description: |
        A cheerful doorway leads to what smells like... home? The unmistakable
        aroma of the Fantastipants family kitchen wafts through. Someone has
        recreated it down here. How thoughtful! And slightly creepy!
        
    east:
      destination: ../coatroom/
      description: |
        An ornate doorway draped with velvet curtains in a dozen clashing colors.
        Beyond, you glimpse racks upon racks of costumes — feathers, sequins, 
        armor, ball gowns, spacesuits, and things that defy description.
        
        A sign reads: "THE FANTASTIPANTS COSTUME EMPORIUM — BE ANYONE YOU WANT!"

  ambience: |
    Water drips somewhere in the darkness — the universal soundtrack
    of underground adventure. The air is cool and smells of earth,
    mystery, and faintly of ancient riddles.
