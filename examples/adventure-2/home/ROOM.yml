    You are home.
    
    The kitchen is warm. A pie cools on the windowsill — apple, of course.
    The table is set for two. Gold coins glitter in a pile. The Jeweled 
    Chalice catches the fading sunlight.
    
    On the mantle, a brass lamp glows soft blue. Retired with honor.
    On the wall, a wedge of weaponized cheese hangs in a place of pride.
    On the counter, a notebook bulges with letters, songs, and photos.
    
    And here, wearing matching Nomi capes — one purple with lightning,
    one black with stars — stand the Fantastipants:
    
    Mother. Hero. Home.
    
    The dishes are done.
    All promises are kept.
    The adventure is complete.

  ambience: |
    The smell of apple pie. The warmth of the stove. The soft blue glow
    of a lamp that never went dark. The clink of gold. The rustle of capes.
    The sound of Mother humming.
    
    Home.
