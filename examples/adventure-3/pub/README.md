## 🧑‍🍳 The Bartender

**Grim** (default theme) — weathered, knowing, always polishing that glass.

The bartender:
- 🧠 **Knows everything** (but charges for specifics)
- 👁️ **Remembers everyone** (including Mother)
- 🔑 **Guards the back room** (earn access)
- 🎭 **Transforms with theme** (but stays mysterious)

### Key Topics

| Topic | Cost | Reveals |
|-------|------|---------|
| The maze | Free | General warnings |
| The grue | 10 gold | Patrol patterns |
| Mother | 30 gold | "She came through here..." |
| The skeleton | 10 gold | Full backstory |
| The back room | Prove yourself | ??? |

The pub is a tribute to:
- **Bar Karma** (Will Wright & Don Hopkins) — First crowdsourced TV series. A bar at the edge of the universe where lost souls face karmic crossroads. StoryMaker tool for collaborative script writing and community voting.

- The cantina in Star Wars
- Rick's Café in Casablanca
- The Prancing Pony (LotR)
- Cheers (everybody knows your name)

*This is where quests begin and end. And the community shapes the story.*
