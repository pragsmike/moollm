    You stand in a vast circular chamber lined floor-to-ceiling with
    costumes of every conceivable type. Racks spiral outward in
    concentric circles like a fabric tornado frozen in time. The
    air smells of mothballs, greasepaint, and infinite possibility.
    
    A full-length MIRROR stands in the center, ready to show you
    your transformation. A helpful MANNEQUIN holds a clipboard.
    
    Signs hang from the ceiling:
    
      "DESCRIBE ANY COSTUME — WE HAVE IT!"
      "ASK FOR 'RANDOM' FOR A SURPRISE!"
      "COMBINE COSTUMES! MIX AND MATCH!"
      "ADD ACCESSORIES! THE ONLY LIMIT IS YOUR IMAGINATION!"
      "YOUR WAISTCOAT WILL WAIT FOR YOU HERE."
      
    And in smaller, more mysterious letters:
    
      "THE MIRROR SEES MORE THAN YOUR CLOTHES.
       IT SEES YOUR SOUL. AND SOULS CAN BE TAILORED TOO."
    
    The exit WEST leads back to the Chamber of Commencement, from which
    you can go NORTH to the maze, or WEST to the kitchen (for food!).

        The archway back to the Chamber of Commencement. Your old
        identity awaits. Or your new one, depending on perspective.

  ambience: |
    Somewhere in the racks, a feather boa rustles. A sequin catches
    the light and winks at you. The costumes seem to whisper:
    "Wear me. WEAR ME. WEAR MEEEE."
    
    You resist. For now.
