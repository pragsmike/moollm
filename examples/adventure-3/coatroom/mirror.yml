  description: |
    An ornate full-length mirror in a gilded frame carved with masks
    of comedy and tragedy. The glass seems impossibly clear, showing
    not just your reflection but somehow your ESSENCE.
    
    A small plaque reads: "Mirror, mirror, on the stand / show the
    hero, costume planned."
    
    Below it, in smaller letters: "Look deeper. See yourself.
    Change yourself. Or try on someone else."
    
    This is both a costume mirror AND a Mind Mirror — it reflects
    your appearance AND your personality profile.

      mirror because your mirror doesn't say 'well you bad boy get a
      haircut' or the mirror doesn't say 'hey turkey fix your tie' —
      you have to decide that."

      "It's basically a technique you take your own stereotypes of self
      and see it on the screen and then you can massage that thought,
      you can change it. How would I like to be? How was I when I was
      a child? How would I be if I was a woman?"

  # HOW THE LLM GENERATES PROFILES
  generation_guide: |
    When generating Mind Mirror profiles, the LLM:
    
    1. FOR REAL PEOPLE (via K-lines):
       - Draws on documented personality traits
       - Uses published interviews, biographies
       - Activates TRADITION, not persona
       - Example: "Einstein" → high innovative, well-informed, 
         impractical, unconventional
         
    2. FOR FICTIONAL CHARACTERS:
       - Analyzes their canonical behavior
       - Maps actions to dimensions
       - Example: "Sherlock Holmes" → high well-informed, 
         innovative, proud, irritable, uninhibited
         
    3. FOR DESCRIPTIONS:
       - Interprets adjectives into dimensions
       - "Confident" → high confident (duh)
       - "Shy but secretly ambitious" → high timid + high restless
       
    4. FOR RANDOM:
       - Truly random 0-7 for each dimension
       - Often produces interesting emergent personalities
       
    5. FOR "MY IDEAL SELF":
       - Starts from current profile
       - Asks what you'd change
       - Iteratively refines
       
    The goal: SIMPLE NATURAL LANGUAGE → STRUCTURED PROFILE
    
    "Make me braver" → confident +2, timid -2, cautious -1
    
    No sliders. No forms. Just talk to the mirror.

  # EFFECTS ON GAMEPLAY
  gameplay_effects: |
    Mind Mirror profiles affect:
    
    1. DIALOGUE STYLE
       - High confident → never apologizes unnecessarily
       - High creative → unusual metaphors
       - High irritable → snappy responses
       
    2. NPC REACTIONS
       - NPCs respond to your interpersonal style
       - Dominating player → submissive NPC responses
       - Friendly player → friendly NPC responses
       
    3. DECISION TENDENCIES
       - High cautious → asks for more information
       - High impulsive → acts first
       - High practical → seeks efficient solutions
       
    4. STRESS RESPONSES
       - Under threat, personality shows its edges
       - Calm stays calm. Restless gets more restless.
       
    5. ADVERTISEMENTS SCORING
       - Actions that match personality score higher
       - High creative → exploration actions score up
       - High sensible → safe actions score up

    "How would I like to be? How was I when I was a child?
    How would I be if I was a woman? You get the picture —
    suddenly you're freed from this heavy concept of self."
    
    The mirror doesn't judge. YOU decide what to change.
