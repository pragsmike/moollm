From Mother's note on the kitchen table:

## 🎭 Tips for New Adventurers

1. **GET LAMP** — In the start room. Don't enter the maze without it.
2. **Visit the Kitchen** — Everything you need is on the table:
   - 📜 **Mother's Note** — Important instructions and promises
   - 🧭 **TomTomagotchi** — Your navigation pet (GPS + friend!)
   - 📓 **Notebook** — For collecting memories (auto-sorts!)
   - 🍱 **Lunchbox** — For carrying food
3. **Raid the Fridge** — 20 food items for maze mapping.
4. **Visit the Coatroom** — Maurice can help you discover who you want to be.
5. **The Grue Has Respawned** — It's hungry. It's waiting. It's in room-f.
6. **The Vending Machine** — Room J sells Premium Glow Juice (3 gold).
7. **The Skeleton Points West** — Follow its guidance.
8. **There's 100 Gold** — In the grue's lair. If you dare.
