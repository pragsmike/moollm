    The darkness swallows you whole. But wait—
    
    A warm light. A sense of beginnings. The smell of slightly
    damp stone and narrative convenience.
    
    You awaken in the Chamber of Commencement. Your score has
    been reset to 0, but your inventory remains intact. The 
    universe is merciful, if slightly disappointed in you.

    You are standing in a small chamber carved from living rock. The walls
    bear the scratched initials of adventurers past:
    
      "WC+DW '76"       — Will Crowther & Don Woods, the founders
      "SA '78"          — Scott Adams, who brought adventures home
      "XYZZY WAS HERE"  — A mystery, a magic word, a tradition
      
      "CA '26"          — Captain Ashford, Grue Slayer (adventure-2)
      "(BF underneath)" — Bumblewick Fantastipants, hero beneath the cape
    
    The newest carvings smell faintly of blue cheese. A legend passed through here.
    
    The chamber is suffused with a soft, sourceless glow — the kind of
    magical light that adventure games provide to starting areas so that
    heroes don't immediately die in the dark. How thoughtful.
    
    A brass lamp sits on a natural stone shelf, freshly refilled and waiting.
    You should probably GET that before going anywhere. Just a friendly suggestion.
    
    Near the entrance, a GRAND MAILBOX stands — improbably permanent, 
    improbably wooden, with a brass flag that's currently UP. You have mail.
    (This is a Zorkian tradition. CHECK MAIL!)
    
    Five exits beckon:
    
    NORTH: A rough archway leading into ABSOLUTE darkness. The kind where
    you are likely to be eaten by a grue. The grue has respawned.
    
    SOUTH: A warm glow and the murmur of conversation. A wooden sign 
    creaks: "THE RUSTY LANTERN — Est. ???" A proper pub for proper heroes.
    
    WEST: A cheerful doorway smelling of home cooking. The Fantastipants
    Family Kitchen, where Mother's note waits.
    
    EAST: An ornate doorway draped in velvet. Costumes glitter beyond.
    Maurice the Magnificent awaits in the Costume Emporium.
    
    UP: A stairway leading to warm light and the smell of pie. Home.
    (Discovered by the previous adventurer. Goes to the surface.)
    
    (Your score is 0. Base goal: +10 for treasure. Bonus points for style.)

  exits:
    north:
      destination: ../maze/room-a/
      description: |
        A rough archway carved through the rock. Beyond it, shadows pool
        like spilled ink. Your lamp's light doesn't quite reach whatever
        lies ahead. You have a bad feeling about this.
        
        Someone scratched "ABANDON HOPE" on the archway, then crossed
        it out and wrote "A HERO PASSED THROUGH HERE" underneath.
        
    west:
      destination: ../kitchen/
      description: |
        A cheerful doorway leads to what smells like... home? The unmistakable
        aroma of the Fantastipants family kitchen wafts through. 
        
    east:
      destination: ../coatroom/
      description: |
        An ornate doorway draped with velvet curtains in a dozen clashing colors.
        Beyond, you glimpse racks upon racks of costumes — feathers, sequins, 
        armor, ball gowns, spacesuits, and things that defy description.
        
        A sign reads: "THE FANTASTIPANTS COSTUME EMPORIUM — BE ANYONE YOU WANT!"
        
    up:
      destination: ../home/
      description: |
        A stairway carved into the rock, leading up towards warm light.
        The smell of home cooking wafts down. This exit was always here,
        but previous adventurers revealed it.
        
    south:
      destination: ../pub/
      description: |
        A heavy wooden door with a brass handle, warm light leaking from
        beneath. The sign creaks in a nonexistent breeze: "THE RUSTY LANTERN"
        
        From within, you hear the clink of glasses, low conversation, and 
        the unmistakable sound of someone losing badly at darts. This is
        where adventurers gather to share tales, drown sorrows, and find
        their next quest.
        
        The pub has always been here. Or so the bartender claims.

  # Atmosphere
  ambience: |
    Water drips somewhere in the darkness — the universal soundtrack
    of underground adventure. The air is cool and smells of earth,
    mystery, and the lingering scent of legends past.
