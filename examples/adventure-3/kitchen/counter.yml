    A long granite counter runs along one wall, scarred by years of
    Fantastipants family experiments. Burn marks, knife scratches,
    mysterious stains — each one tells a story.
    
    A small plaque is bolted to the edge:
    
    "THE FANTASTIPANTS WORKBENCH
     Where Ideas Become Things™
     (And Sometimes Things Become Other Things)"
    
    The surface shimmers slightly. It's not just a counter.
    It's a CRAFTING TABLE.
    
  examine: |
    You run your hand across the counter. It tingles.
    
    This surface can:
    - COMBINE items to create new things
    - TRANSFORM items into different forms
    - DUPLICATE items (with limitations)
    - EDIT item properties
    - PROGRAM item behaviors
    
    Place items on the counter. Describe what you want.
    The DM interprets your intent and creates the result.
    
    On the counter you see:
    📋 **Recipe Holder** — Family recipes (some legendary!)
    📦 **ACME Catalog** — Mail-order mayhem
    
    Below the counter:
    🗄️ **Three Drawers** — MacGyver supplies

  actions:
    PLACE:
      description: "Put an item on the counter"
      usage: "PLACE [item] ON COUNTER"
      effect: "Item moves from inventory to workspace"
      
    TAKE:
      description: "Take an item from the counter"
      usage: "TAKE [item] FROM COUNTER"
      effect: "Item moves from workspace to inventory"
      
    COMBINE:
      description: "Merge multiple items into one"
      usage: "COMBINE [item1] WITH [item2] (WITH [item3]...)"
      requires: "2+ items on counter"
      effect: |
        DM interprets the combination:
        - What would these items become together?
        - What properties does the result have?
        - Is the combination reversible?
        
        Creates new .yml file for the result.
        
      examples:
        - input: "cheese + bread"
          output: "cheese_sandwich.yml"
          
        - input: "lamp + blue cheese"
          output: "stink_lamp.yml (repels grues at distance)"
          
        - input: "notebook + Tom"
          output: "smart_notebook.yml (Tom can write in it)"
          
        - input: "broken compass + Tom"
          output: "??? (Tom is VERY curious about this)"
          
    TRANSFORM:
      description: "Change an item into something else"
      usage: "TRANSFORM [item] INTO [description]"
      requires: "1 item on counter"
      effect: |
        DM interprets the transformation:
        - Is this plausible given the source material?
        - What properties transfer? What's lost?
        - How dramatic is the change?
        
        Updates or replaces the item's .yml file.
        
      examples:
        - input: "TRANSFORM apple INTO apple pie"
          output: "apple_pie.yml (needs oven to complete)"
          
        - input: "TRANSFORM lamp INTO lantern"
          output: "lantern.yml (different light pattern)"
          
        - input: "TRANSFORM blue cheese INTO weapon"
          output: "gorgonzola_glaive.yml (legendary!)"
          
    DUPLICATE:
      description: "Create a copy of an item"
      usage: "DUPLICATE [item]"
      requires: "1 item on counter"
      cost: "May require materials or have limits"
      effect: |
        Creates a copy. But copies have quirks:
        - Slightly different (DM adds variation)
        - May degrade over time
        - Original and copy may be linked
        
        Creates new .yml file: [item]_copy.yml
        
      limitations: |
        Cannot duplicate:
        - Unique items (treasure, quest objects)
        - Sentient items (they refuse)
        - Tom (there can be only one)
        
    EDIT:
      description: "Modify an item's properties"
      usage: "EDIT [item]: [changes]"
      requires: "1 item on counter"
      effect: |
        Freeform editing of item properties:
        - Change name, description, appearance
        - Add or remove abilities
        - Adjust stats, values, behaviors
        
        DM updates the .yml file accordingly.
        
      examples:
        - input: "EDIT lamp: make it pink"
          changes: "glow.color: pink"
          
        - input: "EDIT cheese: add prophecy ability"
          changes: "abilities: [prophecy] (why not?)"
          
        - input: "EDIT lunchbox: expand capacity to 100"
          changes: "capacity: 100 (TARDIS upgrade)"
          
    PROGRAM:
      description: "Add behaviors and triggers to an item"
      usage: "PROGRAM [item]: [behavior description]"
      requires: "1 item on counter"
      effect: |
        Add conditional behaviors:
        - When X happens, do Y
        - If condition, then action
        - On trigger, activate effect
        
        DM adds behaviors to item's .yml file.
        
      examples:
        - input: "PROGRAM lamp: glow red when grue is near"
          adds: |
            behaviors:
              grue_warning:
                trigger: "grue within 2 rooms"
                effect: "glow.color: red, emit warning"
                
        - input: "PROGRAM cheese: insult anyone who tries to eat me"
          adds: |
            behaviors:
              self_defense:
                trigger: "EAT attempted"
                effect: "speak insult, -1 affection"
                
        - input: "PROGRAM notebook: summarize each day at midnight"
          adds: |
            behaviors:
              daily_summary:
                trigger: "time: midnight"
                effect: "generate summary, append to contents"
                
    ANALYZE:
      description: "Examine an item's properties in detail"
      usage: "ANALYZE [item]"
      requires: "1 item on counter"
      effect: |
        DM reads the item's .yml file and explains:
        - All properties and values
        - All behaviors and triggers
        - Possible combinations
        - Hidden features (if any)
        
    CLEAR:
      description: "Remove all items from counter"
      usage: "CLEAR COUNTER"
      effect: "All items return to inventory"

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # DM GUIDELINES
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  
  dm_guidelines: |
    The counter is a CREATIVE TOOL. Be generous with interpretations!
    
    COMBINE: What would these items naturally become together?
    TRANSFORM: Is this plausible? Make it work if possible.
    DUPLICATE: Add quirks to copies — never perfect clones.
    EDIT: Honor the player's intent, add interesting side effects.
    PROGRAM: Behaviors should be fun, not game-breaking.
    
    The counter enables:
    - Experimentation without permanent loss
    - Player creativity becoming game mechanics
    - Emergent item behaviors
    - PLAY-LEARN-LIFT for object design
    
    Always create/update .yml files for results!
    Persistence makes crafting REAL.

  mothers_warning: |
    "Bumblewick! The counter is for FOOD PREPARATION, not
    mad science experiments! ...although I suppose if you
    DO invent something useful, I'd like to see it.
    
    And please don't order from that ACME catalog. Your
    father still has the scar from the Rocket Skates."
