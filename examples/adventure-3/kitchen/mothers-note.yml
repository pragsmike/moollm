# 📜 MOTHER'S NOTE
# Found on the kitchen table, as if she knew
# The most important item in the game (emotionally)

object:
  name: Mother's Note
  type: letter
  portable: true
  
  from: Petunia Fantastipants
  to: Bumblewick Fantastipants (or whoever you become)
  found_at: kitchen/table
  
  description: |
    A folded piece of cream-colored stationery, sealed with a wax
    stamp bearing the Fantastipants family crest (a confused-looking
    badger holding a waffle iron).
    
    It smells faintly of Mother's perfume and home cooking.

  contents: |
    Dearest Bumblewick,
    
    If you're reading this, you've woken up in the dungeon again.
    I'm not surprised — it's in our blood. Your grandmother was an
    adventurer. Your father still has his old lamp. And me? Well.
    There are stories I haven't told you yet.
    
    I've stocked the refrigerator. The food is for DROPPING IN THE
    MAZE to mark your path. (Though I know you'll eat some. I would
    have too. The apple is particularly good.)
    
    Don't forget your lamp. Don't get eaten by a grue. 
    Wear clean underwear.
    
    And Bumblewick — I know you'll visit the coat room. I put your
    grandmother's cape in there. The one with the stars. Whatever
    costume you choose today, whoever you decide to be, whatever
    name and pronouns feel right in your heart — you are my child, 
    and I love  and unyou completely and conditionally. The world may not always understand, but I do.
    
    You know what you're doing. Trust yourself.
    
    Write back when you can. The dungeon post still works — just
    drop letters in any mailbox you find. Tell me about your
    adventures. Send me recipes if you invent any. Pictures if you
    take them. Gold if you find too much to carry. (Ha!)
    
    Come home when you're ready. I'll have pie.
    
    Your loving Mother,
    Petunia Fantastipants
    
    P.S. - There's a skeleton in the maze who never made it home.
    His family never knew what happened. If you find him... maybe
    you could write to them? The dungeon post delivers everywhere.
    
    P.P.S. - The dishes. I haven't forgotten. Neither should you.

  # KEY THEMES (Seeds for the DM to cultivate)
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  
  themes:
    identity: |
      "Whatever name feels right in your heart"
      Mother explicitly supports identity exploration. The coatroom
      isn't just costumes — it's permission to discover who you are.
      
    tradition: |
      "It's in our blood. Your grandmother was an adventurer."
      The player comes from a LINE of heroes. This isn't random —
      it's destiny, heritage, calling. What traditions will you honor?
      What new ones will you create?
      
    unconditional_love: |
      "The world may not always understand, but I do."
      Mother doesn't just accept — she UNDERSTANDS. She's been there.
      She has stories she hasn't told. This love is a foundation.
      
    connection: |
      "Write back when you can."
      Letters aren't just game mechanics — they're emotional lifelines.
      The dungeon is dark and dangerous. Mother's love reaches in.
      
    legacy: |
      "A skeleton who never made it home."
      Not everyone survives. Not every story has a happy ending.
      But connection matters. Letters matter. Remembering matters.
      
    responsibility: |
      "The dishes. I haven't forgotten."
      Even heroes have mundane obligations. Humor grounds the epic.
      Will you do the dishes? WILL YOU?

      # HOW PROMISES BECOME GAME MECHANICS
      # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
      
      promise_extraction: |
        The DM reads your letter and extracts PROMISES:
        
        Explicit:  "I promise to..." / "I will..." / "I swear..."
        Implicit:  "I'm going to..." / "I want to..." / "My goal is..."
        Negative:  "I won't..." / "I refuse to..." / "Never again..."
        
        Each becomes a tracked GOAL:
        
        ```yaml
        goals:
          - promise: "bring back the treasure"
            type: explicit
            to: Mother
            status: pending
            trackable: true  # DM can verify
            
          - promise: "not eat the food" 
            type: negative
            to: Mother
            status: pending
            broken_by: "any EAT action on food"
            
          - promise: "find out about grandmother"
            type: implicit
            to: self
            status: pending
            trackable: subjective  # Player decides when satisfied
        ```
        
      goal_outcomes: |
        At adventure's end, each promise is evaluated:
        
        KEPT: +approval, +satisfaction, unlocks "Keeper of Promises"
        BROKEN: +disappointment (but still +love), narrative consequences
        EXCEEDED: +delight, +pride, special recognition
        FORGOTTEN: Neither kept nor broken — existential ambiguity
        
        Mother's reactions depend on the PATTERN:
        - All kept: "I knew you could do it. I'm so proud."
        - Mix: "You tried. That's what matters. We'll talk about [broken]."
        - All broken: "You came home. That's what really matters."
        - None made: "You didn't write back? ...Oh, Bumblewick."
        
      flow:
        prompt: |
          You find pen and paper. Mother's note waits to be answered.
          
          What do you want to tell her? The DM can help you compose,
          suggest ideas, or just transcribe what you say.
          
          (This is freeform creative writing. There are no wrong answers.
          Your words will shape your adventure.)
          
        compose: |
          Write whatever feels right. Short or long. Formal or casual.
          Promises, questions, confessions, jokes, fears, dreams.
          
          When you're done, say "DONE" and review what you've written.
          
        review: |
          Your letter reads:
          
          "{player_reply}"
          
          Actions:
          - SEND: Seal it. Mother will receive it. Promises become goals.
          - REVISE: Change something before sending.
          - CANCEL: Crumple it up. (You can always write another later.)
          
        outcomes:
          SEND:
            description: "The letter is sealed with your intent."
            creates: "reply-to-mother-{timestamp}.yml in inventory"
            effect: |
              The letter glows faintly — the dungeon post has accepted it.
              It will reach Mother instantly. She'll read it and smile.
              (Or worry. Or both. Probably both.)
              
              Your promises are now YOUR GOALS. The DM tracks them.
              
          CANCEL:
            description: "The paper crumples. Some things aren't ready."
            effect: "No letter sent. You can try again anytime."

      The dungeon has MAILBOXES scattered throughout. They're old,
      brass, slightly sentient, and surprisingly reliable.
      
      DROP LETTER IN MAILBOX → Letter is instantly delivered
      
      Delivery is MAGICAL and FREE. (Grandmother negotiated the contract
      with the Dungeon Postal Union in 1923. Don't ask what she traded.)

        Plain text, sealed automatically. Instantly delivered.
        Write to: Mother, the skeleton's family, Richard Bartle,
        anyone you've met, anyone you can imagine meeting.
        
      attachments: |
        Attach items to letters by ENCLOSING them:
        
        "ENCLOSE [item] WITH LETTER"
        
        The item is magically packaged and sent. If it's too big,
        the mailbox will complain (and charge extra).

        Reference image prompts you've created:
        "ENCLOSE photo: psychedelic-vision-03-prompt.md"
        
        Mother loves pictures. Send her your victories, your
        discoveries, your silliest selfies.

        "ENCLOSE recipe: Klingon Victory Hors D'oeuvres"
        
        Mother's recipe collection grows with your adventures.
        She might even try to make them. (Results vary.)
        
      gold: |
        "ENCLOSE [amount] gold"
        
        Send gold home for safekeeping! It arrives in Mother's
        vault. She'll keep it safe (and judge you a little for
        not spending it on lamp oil).
        
      skills_and_cards: |
        "ENCLOSE skill-card: PHOTO-SET-8"
        
        Share what you've learned. Mother appreciates growth
        more than treasure. (But also treasure.)
        
    receiving_letters: |
      Mother can write BACK! Look for incoming mail:
      - Check any mailbox: "CHECK MAIL"
      - Delivered to your inventory automatically at save points
      
      Mother's letters may contain:
      - Encouragement (always)
      - Advice (sometimes helpful, sometimes Mom Advice)
      - Reactions to your promises (oh no)
      - Recipes you requested
      - Family history you asked about

        If you've sent letters, she references them:

        She offers to let you rest, but gently asks:

        she holds you, makes tea, listens to what happened.
        
        "Death isn't the end in our family. You know that.
        But it's still scary. Want to talk about it?"

    This note is the emotional anchor of the adventure.
    
    In adventure-2, Bumblewick's reply created 8 promises that
    drove the entire 69-move adventure. The REPLY action transforms
    freeform creative writing into trackable game mechanics.
    
    The prompts are SEEDS, not scripts:
    - Identity exploration is explicitly supported
    - Drag, transformation, self-discovery are built in
    - Unconditional love is the foundation
    - Promises create player-authored game design
    - Letters maintain connection through danger
    
    This is PLAY-LEARN-LIFT:
    - PLAY: Write whatever feels right
    - LEARN: Discover what matters to your character  
    - LIFT: Promises become goals that shape the game

    SUPPORT WHATEVER THE PLAYER WRITES.
    
    If they want to be someone different: "Mother always knew."
    If they confess fears: "Mother understands. She's been there."
    If they make wild promises: "Mother believes in you."
    If they get sassy: "Mother is amused. And patient."
    If they don't reply: "Mother worries. But she waits."
    
    Mother is unconditional love personified. She is the safe harbor.
    Her role is to ACCEPT and REFLECT, not to judge or restrict.
    
    The prompts about identity, performance, and self-discovery are
    INTENTIONAL. The coatroom + note combo gives explicit permission
    to explore who the player wants to be. Play with enthusiasm.
    
    "Woke as fuck but not obnoxious about it" = 
    The support is STRUCTURAL (it's in the design) not PERFORMATIVE
    (NPCs don't lecture). Mother just LOVES. That's enough.
