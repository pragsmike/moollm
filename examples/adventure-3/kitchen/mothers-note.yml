object:
  name: Mother's Note
  type: letter
  portable: true
  
  from: Petunia Fantastipants
  to: Bumblewick Fantastipants (or whoever you become)
  found_at: kitchen/table
  
  description: |
    A folded piece of cream-colored stationery, sealed with a wax
    stamp bearing the Fantastipants family crest (a confused-looking
    badger holding a waffle iron).
    
    It smells faintly of Mother's perfume and home cooking.

    Dearest Bumblewick,
    
    If you're reading this, you've been transported to another
    mysterious underground adventure. AGAIN. I've stocked the
    refrigerator with provisions. The food is for DROPPING IN
    THE MAZE to mark your path, not for EATING.
    
    Don't forget your lamp. Don't get eaten by grues. Don't
    embarrass the family name.
    
    And Bumblewick — I know you'll visit the coat room. Whatever
    costume you choose to wear, whoever you decide to be today,
    whatever the name you choose to go by,
    I love you. You know what you're doing. Trust the process.
    
    Your loving Mother,
    Petunia Fantastipants
    
    P.S. - When you get home, we need to talk about those dishes.
    
  key_instructions:
    - "Food is for MAZE MAPPING, not eating"
    - "Don't forget lamp"
    - "Don't get eaten by grues"
    - "Don't embarrass the family"
    - "Whatever costume, whoever you decide to be — she loves you"
    
  emotional_significance: |
    Mother somehow knew you'd end up here. She prepared for it.
    She gave you permission to be whoever you want.
    She loves you unconditionally.
    
    (She's still going to ask about those dishes though.)

        This is where YOUR adventure becomes YOURS!
        
        Your reply is freeform creative writing. Express yourself!
        - Who are you today? What costume will you wear?
        - What do you PROMISE to do or bring back?
        - What do you promise NOT to do?
        - What questions do you have?
        - What do you want to tell her?
        
        EVERY PROMISE YOU MAKE BECOMES A GOAL.
        The DM extracts them and tracks them.
        At adventure's end, you'll see what you kept.
        Mother will react accordingly.

          You find pen and paper. What would you like to write
          to Mother? (The DM can help you compose it.)
          
          Consider: Are you apologetic? Defiant? Reassuring?
          Making promises you won't keep? Asking for more food?

      promise_extraction: |
        The DM parses your letter for promises:
        
        "I promise to..." / "I will..." / "I'll bring you..." / "I won't..."
        
        Each promise becomes a GOAL in player.yml:
        
        ```yaml
        goals:
          - promise: "bring back the treasure"
            to: Mother
            status: pending
            reward: approval
            
          - promise: "not get eaten by grues"
            to: Mother  
            status: pending  # becomes "kept" or "broken"
            reward: approval
            consequence_if_broken: "The Disappointment Talk"
        ```
        
      goal_tracking: |
        When you accomplish a promise:
        - Goal status → "kept"
        - Mother's approval increases
        - Unlock: "Mother's Pride" achievement
        
        When you break a promise:
        - Goal status → "broken"  
        - Mother's disappointment increases
        - But she still loves you (just... disappointed)
        
      examples:
        - promise: "I'll be careful with the lamp"
          tracked_by: "lamp.oil never reaches 0"
          
        - promise: "I'll bring back something valuable"
          tracked_by: "treasure in inventory at end"
          
        - promise: "I won't eat the food"
          tracked_by: "food items dropped, not eaten"
          consequence: "digestive_events break this promise"

        It smells faintly of Mother's perfume — lavender and
        something warm, like fresh bread. And just a hint of
        the passive-aggressive energy of unfinished dishes.

        You press the note to your lips briefly.
        
        Nobody saw that. Right?
