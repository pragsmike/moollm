  description: |
    A folded piece of cream-colored stationery, sealed with a wax
    stamp bearing the Fantastipants family crest (a confused-looking
    badger holding a waffle iron).
    
    It smells faintly of Mother's perfume and home cooking.

  contents: |
    Dearest Bumblewick,
    
    If you're reading this, you've woken up in the dungeon again.
    I'm not surprised — it's in our blood. Your grandmother was an
    adventurer. Your father still has his old lamp. And me? Well.
    There are stories I haven't told you yet.
    
    I've stocked the refrigerator. The food is for DROPPING IN THE
    MAZE to mark your path. (Though I know you'll eat some. I would
    have too. The apple is particularly good.)
    
    Don't forget your lamp. Don't get eaten by a grue. 
    Wear clean underwear.
    
    And Bumblewick — I know you'll visit the coat room. I put your
    grandmother's cape in there. The one with the stars. Whatever
    costume you choose today, whoever you decide to be, whatever
    name and pronouns feel right in your heart — you are my child, 
    and I love you completely and conditionally. The world may 
    not always understand, but I do.
    
    You know what you're doing. Trust yourself.
    
    Write back when you can. The dungeon post still works — just
    drop letters in any mailbox you find. Tell me about your
    adventures. Send me recipes if you invent any. Pictures if you
    take them. Gold if you find too much to carry. (Ha!)
    
    Come home when you're ready. I'll have pie.
    
    Your loving Mother,
    Petunia Fantastipants
    
    P.S. - There's a skeleton in the maze who never made it home.
    His family never knew what happened. If you find him... maybe
    you could write to them? The dungeon post delivers everywhere.
    
    P.P.S. - The dishes. I haven't forgotten. Neither should you.

  themes:
    identity: |
      "Whatever name feels right in your heart"
      Mother explicitly supports identity exploration. The coatroom
      isn't just costumes — it's permission to discover who you are.
      
    tradition: |
      "It's in our blood. Your grandmother was an adventurer."
      The player comes from a LINE of heroes. This isn't random —
      it's destiny, heritage, calling. What traditions will you honor?
      What new ones will you create?
      
    unconditional_love: |
      "The world may not always understand, but I do."
      Mother doesn't just accept — she UNDERSTANDS. She's been there.
      She has stories she hasn't told. This love is a foundation.
      
    connection: |
      "Write back when you can."
      Letters aren't just game mechanics — they're emotional lifelines.
      The dungeon is dark and dangerous. Mother's love reaches in.
      
    legacy: |
      "A skeleton who never made it home."
      Not everyone survives. Not every story has a happy ending.
      But connection matters. Letters matter. Remembering matters.
      
    responsibility: |
      "The dishes. I haven't forgotten."
      Even heroes have mundane obligations. Humor grounds the epic.
      Will you do the dishes? WILL YOU?

      # HOW PROMISES BECOME GAME MECHANICS
      # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
      
      promise_extraction: |
        The DM reads your letter and extracts PROMISES:
        
        Explicit:  "I promise to..." / "I will..." / "I swear..."
        Implicit:  "I'm going to..." / "I want to..." / "My goal is..."
        Negative:  "I won't..." / "I refuse to..." / "Never again..."
        
        Each becomes a tracked GOAL:
        
        ```yaml
        goals:
          - promise: "bring back the treasure"
            type: explicit
            to: Mother
            status: pending
            trackable: true  # DM can verify
            
          - promise: "not eat the food" 
            type: negative

      # 🎯 DYNAMIC SCORING — Rewards calculated at completion!
      # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
      
      dynamic_scoring: |
        Scores are NOT fixed at promise time — they're EVALUATED at completion!
        
        The DM calculates rewards based on:
        - HOW the promise was kept (style, creativity, difficulty)
        - WHAT emerged along the way (skills, discoveries, relationships)
        - CONTEXT at completion (world state, other accomplishments)
        - REVIEWS from characters (Mother's opinion, NPC reactions)
        
        This means the SAME promise can earn different scores depending
        on HOW you fulfill it!
        
      score_calculation:
        base_scores: |
          Each promise has a BASE score set at extraction:
          
          ```yaml
          - promise: "bring back treasure"
            base_score: 10  # Standard goal
            
          - promise: "not eat the food"
            base_score: 5   # Restraint goal
            
          - promise: "slay the grue"
            base_score: 20  # Ambitious goal
          ```
          
        modifiers: |

        skill_inheritance: |
          Skills can be PASSED DOWN:
          
          BEQUEATH SKILL [skill] TO [recipient]
          
          Recipients:
          - Future adventurers (in your family line)
          - NPCs (they gain the skill permanently)
          - The world itself (skill becomes common knowledge)

        Your letter doesn't just shape YOUR adventure — it shapes MOTHER.
        
        The things you write ABOUT her become TRUE about her.
        The questions you ask REVEAL her history.
        The assumptions you make DEFINE her character.

          When you mention or ask about Mother's past, you CREATE it:
          
          "What happened in YOUR first adventure?"
          → Mother HAD a first adventure. Now she has a story to tell.
          
          "Did you know grandmother was a hero?"
          → Mother knew. She has FEELINGS about it. What are they?
          
          "Were you and father adventurers together?"
          → Now they were. A romance blooms in backstory.
          
          "Why didn't you tell me about the grue?"
          → Mother had REASONS. Protective? Traumatic? Forgetful?
          
          "Do I have any siblings?"
          → Now you DO. Lost? Estranged? Adventuring elsewhere?
          
          "What happened to my childhood pet?"
          → There WAS a pet. Where are they now? Quest seed planted!
          
          "Who else is in our family?"
          → Relatives emerge: cousins, aunts, grandparents, black sheep

          When you ASK about family, family APPEARS!
          
          Each question seeds a potential REUNION QUEST:
          
          SIBLING DISCOVERY:
          "Do I have a brother/sister?"
          → YES! You do! But where are they?
          
          Options (DM chooses or player suggests):
          - Lost in the maze years ago (rescue quest!)
          - Adventuring in a different dungeon (crossover!)
          - Estranged after a family argument (reconciliation!)
          - Actually the skeleton in room-i (tragedy!)

          Options:
          - Waiting loyally in a maze room (tearful reunion!)
          - Transformed by dungeon magic (rescue quest!)

          - Living with the skeleton (sad but sweet!)
          - Running the dungeon postal service (explains a lot!)
          
          EXTENDED FAMILY:
          "Tell me about grandmother/grandfather/uncle/aunt"
          → Family tree grows! Each relative is a potential:
          - Quest giver (find their lost artifact!)
          - Companion (recruit them to party!)
          - Source of skills (learn family traditions!)
          - Plot twist (they're not who you thought!)

            - The Skeleton (if you solve their unfinished business)

            Ask about pets → pet emerges
            Ask about old friends → friend emerges
            
            Each generated companion has:

          "I want to make you proud" → Pride matters to her
          "I'll bring you something beautiful" → She values beauty
          "I'll tell you everything" → She craves connection
          "I'll come home safe" → Safety is her priority
          "I'll be brave like you" → She sees herself as brave (or tries to)
          
        relationship_dynamics: |
          How you address her defines the relationship:
          
          "Dear Mother" → Formal, respectful distance
          "Mom" → Casual, close, comfortable
          "Mama" → Childlike, vulnerable, seeking comfort
          "Petunia" → Adult-to-adult, equals
          "My dearest Mother" → Romantic era, dramatic
          
          You can CHANGE how you address her letter to letter.
          She notices. She adapts. She comments.

          Questions about secrets CREATE secrets:

          "Did something happen to grandmother?" → Now something did
          "Why does the dungeon call our family?" → Now there's a REASON
          "What's in your recipe box you never show us?" → A mystery recipe
          "Did you ever meet Father in the dungeon?" → A love story emerges
          
        goal_seeds: |
          Give Mother goals and she'll pursue them:
          
          "Keep the dishes warm" → She'll have dinner ready
          "Write me back" → Her letters become richer
          "Tell me about grandmother" → She researches, remembers
          "Don't worry" → She tries (and fails) not to worry
          "Be proud of me" → She LOOKS for things to be proud of
          
        behavior_seeds: |
          Predict her behavior and it manifests:
          
          "I know you'll cry when I come home" → She will
          "You probably already know about [X]" → She does
          "You're going to say 'be careful'" → She says it
          "Don't send a care package" → She does anyway
          "I bet you've been checking the mailbox" → Every hour
          
      mother_as_character: |
        MOTHER IS NOT PRE-DEFINED.
        
        She is a COLLABORATIVE CHARACTER built through:
        - What you write in letters
        - What you ask about her
        - What you assume about her
        - What you hope from her
        - What you fear about her
        
        The DM develops Mother based on YOUR input.
        She becomes the mother YOU are writing to.
        
        This means different players get different Mothers:
        - A player who writes formally gets a formal Mother
        - A player who cracks jokes gets a funny Mother
        - A player who shares fears gets a nurturing Mother
        - A player who asks about the past gets a Mother with HISTORY
        
        There is no "wrong" Mother. There is only YOUR Mother.
        
      example_extractions: |
        PLAYER WRITES: "I know you worried when grandmother went to 
        the dungeon and I know you worry about me too."
        
        DM EXTRACTS:
        - Mother worried about grandmother → backstory of family anxiety
        - Mother worries about player → she is protective, nervous
        - Grandmother went to dungeon → grandmother was an adventurer
        - Player knows Mother → relationship is emotionally aware
        
        MOTHER NOW HAS:
        - A history of worrying about adventurers
        - A relationship with HER mother that was complicated
        - An emotional transparency with her child
        - A reason to write long, worried, loving letters
        
      dm_guidance: |
        When player writes something about Mother:
        
        1. ACCEPT it as canon
        2. EXPAND on it in Mother's replies
        3. LET IT SHAPE her behavior in home scenes
        4. REFERENCE it later ("Remember when you asked about...")
        5. COMPLICATE it if dramatically interesting
        
        Mother is a MIRROR that reflects the player's imagination
        back with warmth, depth, and unconditional love.
        
      flow:
        prompt: |
          You find pen and paper. Mother's note waits to be answered.
          
          What do you want to tell her? The DM can help you compose,
          suggest ideas, or just transcribe what you say.
          
          (This is freeform creative writing. There are no wrong answers.
          Your words will shape your adventure.)
          
        compose: |
          Write whatever feels right. Short or long. Formal or casual.
          Promises, questions, confessions, jokes, fears, dreams.
          
          When you're done, say "DONE" and review what you've written.
          
        review: |
          Your letter reads:
          
          "{player_reply}"
          
          Actions:
          - SEND: Seal it. Mother will receive it. Promises become goals.
          - REVISE: Change something before sending.
          - CANCEL: Crumple it up. (You can always write another later.)
          
        outcomes:
          SEND:
            description: "The letter is sealed with your intent."
            creates: "reply-to-mother-{timestamp}.yml in inventory"
            effect: |
              The letter glows faintly — the dungeon post has accepted it.
              It will reach Mother instantly. She'll read it and smile.
              (Or worry. Or both. Probably both.)
              
              Your promises are now YOUR GOALS. The DM tracks them.
              
          CANCEL:
            description: "The paper crumples. Some things aren't ready."
            effect: "No letter sent. You can try again anytime."

      The dungeon has MAILBOXES scattered throughout. They're old,
      brass, slightly sentient, and surprisingly reliable.
      
      DROP LETTER IN MAILBOX → Letter is instantly delivered
      
      Delivery is MAGICAL and FREE. (Grandmother negotiated the contract

        Attach items to letters by ENCLOSING them:
        
        "ENCLOSE [item] WITH LETTER"
        
        The item is magically packaged and sent. If it's too big,
        the mailbox will complain (and charge extra).

      gold: |
        "ENCLOSE [amount] gold"
        
        Send gold home for safekeeping! It arrives in Mother's
        vault. She'll keep it safe (and judge you a little for
        not spending it on lamp oil).

      - Check any mailbox: "CHECK MAIL"
      - Delivered to your inventory automatically at save points
      
      Mother's letters may contain:
      - Encouragement (always)
      - Advice (sometimes helpful, sometimes Mom Advice)
      - Reactions to your promises (oh no)

        Mother gently suggests you're not quite ready to end
        the adventure. She offers pie, encouragement, and a
        nudge back toward the kitchen.

        If you've sent letters, she references them:
        "I got your letter about the skeleton. That was kind."
        "You promised to bring treasure... I see you're still working on it."
        
        She offers to let you rest, but gently asks:

        - Can rest and restore
        - Can deposit gold safely

        she holds you, makes tea, listens to what happened.
        
        "Death isn't the end in our family. You know that.
        But it's still scary. Want to talk about it?"
        
      mechanics:

  lineage: |
    This note is the emotional anchor of the adventure.
    
    In adventure-2, Bumblewick's reply created 8 promises that
    drove the entire 69-move adventure. The REPLY action transforms
    freeform creative writing into trackable game mechanics.
    
    The prompts are SEEDS, not scripts:
    - Identity exploration is explicitly supported
    - Drag, transformation, self-discovery are built in
    - Unconditional love is the foundation
    - Promises create player-authored game design
    - Letters maintain connection through danger
    
    This is PLAY-LEARN-LIFT:
    - PLAY: Write whatever feels right
    - LEARN: Discover what matters to your character  
    - LIFT: Promises become goals that shape the game
    
  dm_notes: |
    SUPPORT WHATEVER THE PLAYER WRITES.
    
    If they want to be someone different: "Mother always knew."
    If they confess fears: "Mother understands. She's been there."
    If they make wild promises: "Mother believes in you."
    If they get sassy: "Mother is amused. And patient."
    If they don't reply: "Mother worries. But she waits."
    
    Mother is unconditional love personified. She is the safe harbor.
    Her role is to ACCEPT and REFLECT, not to judge or restrict.
    
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    MOTHER IS CO-CREATED BY THE PLAYER
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    When players write about Mother, they DEFINE her:
    
    - Questions about her past → She HAS that past now
    - Assumptions about her feelings → Those ARE her feelings
    - Hopes for her behavior → She WILL behave that way
    - References to her history → That history is CANON
    
    EVERY LETTER SHAPES MOTHER. She is a collaborative character.
    
    Different players get different Mothers:
    - Formal players → dignified, traditional Mother
    - Silly players → funny, playful Mother
    - Vulnerable players → nurturing, perceptive Mother
    - Curious players → Mother with DEEP history
    
    Read the player's letters carefully. Extract:
    - Backstory seeds (grandmother, father, past adventures)
    - Personality seeds (how they address her, what they expect)
    - Aspiration seeds (what they want FOR her)
    - Relationship dynamics (how close, how formal)
    - Secrets (questions CREATE mysteries)
    
    Then REFLECT these back in Mother's replies and behavior.
    She becomes the Mother the player is imagining.
    
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    The prompts about identity, performance, and self-discovery are
    INTENTIONAL. The coatroom + note combo gives explicit permission
    to explore who the player wants to be. Play with enthusiasm.
    
    "Woke as fuck but not obnoxious about it" = 
    The support is STRUCTURAL (it's in the design) not PERFORMATIVE
    (NPCs don't lecture). Mother just LOVES. That's enough.
