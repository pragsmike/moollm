  description: |
    A well-worn kitchen table, scarred by decades of Fantastipants
    family meals. You can see the mark where young Bumblewick once
    carved his initials (and was grounded for a week). You can see
    the burn mark from the Great Porridge Incident of '03.
    
    Mother has arranged several items here for your journey.
    
  examine: |
    The table's surface is clear except for your adventure supplies:
    
    📜 **Mother's Note** — Waiting to be read (READ NOTE)
    🥚 **TomTomagotchi** — Chirping hopefully (GET TOM)
    📓 **Notebook** — Empty pages await (GET NOTEBOOK)
    🍱 **Lunchbox** — Ready to raid the fridge (GET LUNCHBOX)
    
    The wood is warm to the touch. Many family memories live here.

        You pull out a chair and sit. The familiar creak of the wood
        is comforting. This is where you've eaten a thousand meals,
        done homework, listened to Mother's stories.

    The table is a CONTAINER, not the items themselves.
    
    Each item has its own .yml file with its own actions:
    - mothers-note.yml → READ, REPLY, SHOW, SMELL, KISS
    - tomtomagotchi.yml → COMPASS, MAP, SNIFF, PET, ASK-TOM
    - notebook.yml → OPEN, WRITE, READ-PAGE, BROWSE
    - lunchbox.yml → OPEN, PUT-IN, TAKE-OUT, EAT
    
    The table just holds these objects until the player takes them.
    When taken, items go to player.inventory and retain their actions.
    
    Strongly suggest the player READ NOTE first, then REPLY!
