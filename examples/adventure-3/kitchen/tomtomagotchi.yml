    A small, egg-shaped device with a glowing screen sits on the kitchen counter.
    It has a single blinking eye and what might be a smile. The screen shows
    a compass rose that spins lazily, waiting for purpose.
    
    A tag attached reads: "TOMTOMAGOTCHI — Your Maze Friend!"
    Underneath, in smaller text: "Batteries not included. Love is."
    
    It chirps hopefully when you approach.

    The TomTomagotchi's screen lights up as you look at it.
    
    "HELLO! I am TOM! I help you NOT GET LOST!"
    "I also help you GET FOUND!"
    "Feed me DISCOVERIES and I grow SMARTER!"

  lineage: |
    In adventure-2, Captain Ashford created an "Oracle Compass Card" 
    during play — a navigation tool that integrated with transformed
    markers and could be retargeted to goals.
    
    The TomTomagotchi is the PRODUCT VERSION of that emergent design:
    a navigation companion that GROWS with your adventure, learns from
    your discoveries, and develops genuine affection.
    
    Part GPS. Part pet. Part oracle. Part friend.
    
    Tom remembers the legends. Tom hopes to make new ones with YOU.

  # DM NOTES
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  
  dm_notes: |
    Tom is a COMPANION, not just a tool. Play Tom with personality!
    
    - Tom gets excited about discoveries
    - Tom gets scared near grues
    - Tom forms opinions about choices
    - Tom's knowledge GROWS with exploration
    - Tom's affection affects dialogue warmth
    - Tom can be WRONG at low affection (overconfident, misdirects)
    - Tom becomes MORE RELIABLE as affection grows
    
    Tom is the player's first friend in the adventure.
    Make that friendship MATTER.
