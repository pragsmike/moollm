  description: |
    A sturdy metal lunchbox with a handle. The previous owner left
    a small note inside:
    
    "For the food. Trust me, you'll need something to carry it all."
    
    It's currently empty, waiting in the kitchen for a new adventurer.
    
  examine: |
    A practical container for maze-mapping provisions. The inside
    is mysteriously clean, despite its obvious history of containing
    many, many transformative food experiences.

  lore: |
    Every adventurer needs a way to carry their maze-mapping provisions.
    This lunchbox has seen things. Many, many things. The kind of things
    that happen when adventurers ignore Mother's warnings about eating.
    
    It doesn't judge. It just carries.
