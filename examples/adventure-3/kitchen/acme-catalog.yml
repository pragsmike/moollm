  description: |
    A dog-eared catalog sits on the counter, its cover showing a
    smiling coyote giving a thumbs up. The ACME logo gleams.
    
    "ORDER ANYTHING! DELIVERED IN 2-4 TURNS!"
    "Satisfaction Guaranteed!*"
    
    *Guarantee does not cover: explosions, implosions, gravity-related
    incidents, ironic timing, roadrunner encounters, or existential dread.
    
  examine: |
    You flip through the catalog. Every page promises wonder.
    Every page has a tiny asterisk leading to tiny print.
    
    The coyote on the cover seems to be watching you.
    Is that... a bandage on his head?

    By ordering from this catalog, you agree that "worked as designed"

  lineage: |
    Inspired by Wile E. Coyote's eternal optimism and the ACME
    Corporation's eternal... creativity with product design.
    
    The malfunction system creates emergent gameplay: even "failures"
    lead to interesting situations. This is PLAY-LEARN-LIFT in action —
    embrace the chaos, learn from the explosions.
