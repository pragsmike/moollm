    The drawers are labeled (in faded paint):
    
    🫙 LEFT:   "Containers"
    🔧 MIDDLE: "Tools"  
    ⚙️ RIGHT:  "Parts"
    
    Each drawer has that wonderful "junk drawer" chaos —
    organized enough to find things, messy enough to
    discover surprises.

    "These drawers have saved our family more times than I can count.
    
    Your father survived the Incident of '89 with nothing but
    twine, three nails, and sheer stubbornness.
    
    Take what you need. Put back what you don't use.
    And for heaven's sake, don't combine the matches with
    the duct tape again. The ceiling JUST got repainted."

  lineage: |
    The "MacGyver Drawer" concept — having random supplies that
    combine in unexpected ways — is core to adventure design.
    
    These items are PRIMITIVES for the crafting system:
    - Combine on counter to create new items
    - Use directly for simple tasks
    - Enable creative problem-solving
    
    The broken compass + Tom combination is a deliberate
    hook for player experimentation (PLAY-LEARN-LIFT).
