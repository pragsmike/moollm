# 🍄 Room H — The Watching Chamber

> *"You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike."*

This one has **MUSHROOMS** growing everywhere. Luminescent fungi that provide a faint, sickly green glow — not enough to light your way properly, but enough to make everything look deeply unsettling.

Some of them pulse gently.

## ✅ GRUE SAFE!

This room is **protected**. Something in the mushrooms — or watching FROM the mushrooms — keeps the grues away.

*"The grue approaches the threshold, drawn by darkness. Then it sees THE EYE. The grue hesitates. Grues do not like being SEEN. The grue retreats."*

## 👁️ The Thing That Watches

See [the-thing-that-watches.yml](./the-thing-that-watches.yml) for full details.

In the center of the room, merging with the mushrooms, pulses **THE THING THAT WATCHES** — a transformed object from a previous adventure (the Suspicious Casserole) that has become a sentient fungal entity.

Its single EYE follows your every movement. **Grues won't enter this room because of The Eye.**

Mother would say not to touch them. Mother would be right.

## 🎭 Feature: The Mushrooms

The mushrooms pulse in a rhythm that almost sounds like breathing. Spores interact with any smells that drift through, creating... interesting combinations.
