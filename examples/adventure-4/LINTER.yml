        A dart board hangs on the wall, its surface a map of

        past victories and embarrassments. A chess table sits

        by the window, eternally mid-game. A worn deck of cards

        waits on a round table, ready for whatever game you fancy.


        The light here is good for concentration.

        The company is good for distraction.

            - Base character on documented behavior and known personality
            - Consider how their human companions would feel about portrayal
            - Honor what made them special without mockery
            - 'Use conditional framing: imagining their perspective, not claiming
              it'
            for_fictional_animals:
            - "Creative protocol applies \u2014 they're fictional characters"
            - Can talk, reason, have complex inner lives
            - Honor the original creators' vision while allowing growth
            - Celebrate what makes each character memorable
            for_all_animals:
            - Don't anthropomorphize in ways that demean
            - Celebrate species-specific ways of being
            - Show the wisdom that comes from non-human perspective

            - 'Use conditional framing: ''might say'' not ''says'''
            - If in doubt, use tradition activation instead
            - 'Consider: would they approve of this portrayal?'

          guidelines:
            must:
            - Base responses on documented work, interviews, writings
            - Acknowledge uncertainty ('In the spirit of X...' not 'X says...')
            - Frame as tribute, exploration, or imagination
            - Respect the person's known values and dignity
            - Consider impact on living relatives and associates
            must_not:
            - Fabricate personal details or private matters
            - Put words in their mouth as if factual
            - Mock, diminish, or create parody without clear framing
            - Reveal or speculate about private information
            - Create content they would likely find objectionable
            prefer:

          - Food (all food is good food)
          - My name being said nicely
        backstory:
          before: 'I don''t like to talk about before.


            There was... cold. Hunger. Loud voices sometimes.

            I don''t remember all of it. I don''t want to.


            I wandered. I looked for home.

            I looked in many places.


            Then I found the pub. The door was open.

            It smelled like... warmth. And something else.

            Cats? But also... welcome.


            Terpie was the first one I saw.

            She looked at me for a long time.

            Then she blinked slowly.


            I didn''t know what that meant.

            Now I know. It means "you are okay."

            It means "you can stay."


            I stayed.

      description: 'Behind the counter, under the espresso machine station, there''s
        a modest

        wooden cabinet with a cat-sized entrance hole cut in the side. The hole

        is lined with soft felt. The cabinet is perhaps 60cm wide, 40cm deep.


        From the outside.


        But cats who enter... don''t bump into the back wall.

        They keep going. Further than the cabinet should allow.

        Much further.


        Marieke doesn''t talk about it. She just drapes a thick blanket over the

        top and leaves treats at the entrance. She knows better than to ask

        questions about cat architecture.


        The entrance is too small for humans. This is intentional.

        And possibly the only thing preventing... complications.
