  # DEBUG MODE — Collapsible technical logs with YAML data islands
  # When enabled: logs show file operations, state changes, links to files
  # When disabled: clean narrative without technical details

    # What to include in debug output:
    show_file_operations: true    # "Created CHARACTER.yml", "Moved to fictional/"
    show_state_changes: true      # "player.location: start/ → coatroom/"
    show_yaml_islands: true       # Embedded YAML with abbreviated data
    show_links: true              # Markdown links to all referenced files
    show_technical_narrative: true # "Under the hood: character owns location..."
    
    # How to format debug sections (natural language instructions):
    format: |
      Wrap technical details in <details> tags with descriptive <summary>.
      Summary should explain the action: "Editing CHARACTER.yml to move 
      player from start/ to coatroom/" — not just "File edit".
      Include relative markdown links: [CHARACTER.yml](./CHARACTER.yml).
      YAML should be abbreviated with # comments on key fields.
      Explain the WHY: why this file, why this field, how MOOLLM works.
