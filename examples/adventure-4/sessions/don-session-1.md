## Session 1 — First Visit

**Player**: Don Hopkins  
**Location**: The Gezelligheid Grotto (pub/)  
**Time**: Evening, Freeday  
**Theme**: Amsterdam Coffeeshop (default)

---

## 🌿 LOOK AROUND

You push open the heavy wooden door and step into the Gezelligheid Grotto.

The warmth hits you first — not just temperature, but *feeling*. This place is aggressively cozy in the best possible way. The Dutch have a word for it: **gezellig**. It means something between "cozy," "convivial," and "belonging." This room IS that word.

### What You See:

**THE BAR** (to your left)
Behind a long, polished wooden counter stands **Marieke van der Berg**, a woman in her 40s with laugh lines that tell stories. Her apron says "Lekker" and she means it. Behind her, a gleaming copper espresso machine from 1952 hisses softly. Bottles of every description line the shelves. The air smells of coffee, cannabis, and something that might be stroopwafels.

She catches your eye and nods. *"Welkom, schat. What can I get you?"*

**THE STAGE** (far end)
A raised wooden platform, maybe two feet up. A single spotlight hangs overhead, slightly askew. Faded burgundy curtains at the back. A sign reads:

```
🎭 TONIGHT: OPEN MIC COMEDY NIGHT
Sign up at bar. 5 min sets. Everyone bombs once.
— Marieke
```

It's Freeday. Comedy night. The mic stands ready.

**THE PIE TABLE** (center-right)
A large, round table with eight chairs, scarred by countless debates. A small brass bell sits in the center. This is where ideas come to fight — sportingly.

**THE FIREPLACE** (right wall)
A crackling fire in a massive stone hearth. The hearthstone has an inscription you can't quite read from here. Several worn armchairs cluster around it.

**THE GAMES CORNER** (left, past the bar)
Dart board. Chess table (mid-game abandoned). Card decks. A shelf of Fluxx boxes.

**THE ARCADE** (back left)
Glowing screens. The *chirp-bloop* of old machines. A fruit machine called "Goblin's Fortune." A Pac-Man cabinet. Someone's high score reads "GRM."

**THE CATS**
They're everywhere. A large orange tabby (**Terpie**) sprawls across a sunny windowsill, not moving. A sleek calico (**Stroopwafel**) prowls behind the bar. You count at least five kittens in various states of activity — one is definitely on the ceiling somehow.

**THE NOTICE BOARD** (near entrance)
Covered in papers. Quests? Jobs? At least one says "ACME" and has scorch marks.

**OTHER PATRONS**
- A man in a worn coat nursing what might be his sixth espresso (**Henk**). A kitten sits in his lap.
- A few clusters at tables, conversations low and warm.
- Someone tuning a guitar near the stage.

## What Would You Like To Do?

The Grotto awaits. Marieke is watching. A kitten is approaching your ankles.

*"First time here?"* she asks, sliding a menu across the counter. *"Or are you coming back to somewhere you've always been?"*

---

## Turn 1: TALK TO MARIEKE ABOUT LUCKY STRAINS

**DON**: *approaches the bar, looking slightly nervous*

"Marieke... I've done something. I ordered a Monkey's Paw from the ACME catalog. It's arriving soon and I... I've heard things. About 2017. I need whatever you've got that might help with luck. All of it."

**MARIEKE**: *freezes mid-polish of a glass. Her eyes go somewhere distant for a moment. Then she sets the glass down with deliberate care.*

"Oh, schat. Oh no. You ordered the—" *she closes her eyes* "—you ordered from the catalog."

*She reaches under the counter and pulls out a lockbox. Her movements are practiced. Too practiced.*

"2017. Ja. We don't talk about 2017." *She opens the box.* "But we PREPARE for it."

*Inside: several jars of premium cannabis, each labeled with careful handwriting.*

### 🍀 THE LUCKY STRAINS SELECTION

Marieke lays them out on the counter like sacred artifacts:

| Strain | Price | Effect | Marieke's Note |
|--------|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Monkey's Blessing** | 15g | Fortune's Mercy buff, malfunction mitigation | "This one. This is THE one. Created AFTER the incident. It won't stop what's coming, but you'll be okay with it." |
| **Postel's Law** | 14g | Enhanced tolerance, robust error handling | "Be liberal in what you accept. You're going to need that flexibility." |
| **Lucky Seven** | 12g | +7% to all random outcomes | "Every little bit helps, schat." |
| **YAML Jazz** | 16g | Pattern recognition +3 | "You might see the chaos coming. Might." |

*She looks at you with genuine concern.*

"How much gold do you have? I'm going to give you a discount. House rules when ACME is involved."

---

### MARIEKE'S ADVICE

*She leans in, voice low:*

"Listen to me carefully. When the package arrives:
1. Don't open it alone
2. Don't make ANY wishes until you've smoked the Blessing
3. Keep Postel's Law nearby — it helps you accept... unexpected interpretations
4. And schat..." *she grabs your wrist* "...be VERY specific with your words. The Paw listens. It listens TOO well."

*Stroopwafel hisses from behind the bar. Even the cat knows.*

"The 2017 incident... three wishes. Three catastrophes. We lost—" *she stops herself* "—we lost things. But we learned. The Blessing came FROM that. Something good from something terrible."

*She slides the jars toward you.*

"How much do you want?"
