    You step through the shimmering portal into a vast crystalline library.
    The walls are made of pure information — text that flows and reorganizes
    as you look at it. Shelves spiral upward into infinity.
    
    This is the Skill Nexus — where the KNOWLEDGE lives.
    
    Not the characters. Not the costumes. The CAPABILITIES.
    
    Here you can study:
    - How to BE a character (the character skill)
    - How to WEAR a persona (the persona skill)
    - How to SEE your soul (the mind-mirror skill)
    - How to PLAY and LEARN and LIFT others (the core methodology)
    
    The library whispers. Every skill is a book. Every book is a door.
    
  atmosphere:
    lighting: crystalline refraction, rainbow caustics
    sound: whispered knowledge, turning pages, distant epiphanies
    feeling: infinite possibility, gentle wisdom, welcome
    
# THE PORTAL NATURE
#
# This room is a BRIDGE between:
# - The adventure world (examples/adventure-4/)
# - The skill library (skills/)
#
# Characters come here to LEARN. Skills come here to be APPLIED.

  portal:
    type: metaphysical
    connects:
      local: examples/adventure-4/
      global: skills/
    description: |
      The Skill Nexus exists in both worlds simultaneously.
      Step through any bookshelf and you're in the global skills library.
      The knowledge there applies everywhere — not just this adventure.

# THE TRINITY OF TRANSFORMATION
#
# COATROOM (west)  — Where you CHANGE (practical)
# CHARACTERS (north of coatroom) — Where you EXIST (embodied)
# PERSONAS (south of coatroom) — Where you PRETEND (theatrical)
# SKILLS (east) — Where you UNDERSTAND (theoretical)
#
# Together they form the complete system of identity in MOOLLM.
# A character (body) wears a persona (mask) using skills (knowledge)
# in the coatroom (dressing room).
