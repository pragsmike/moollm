# CAPTAIN ASHFORD — A Wearable Persona
# 
# This is NOT a character — it's a COSTUME that modifies whoever wears it.
# Any character can wear this persona: Bumblewick, Don Hopkins, anyone.
#
# BASE CHARACTER + PERSONA MODIFIERS = PERFORMED PERSONALITY

persona:
  name: "Captain Kira Ashford"
  id: captain-ashford
  type: wearable_persona
  
  # Where does this persona come from?
  inspiration: |
    Belter captain from The Expanse universe. Weathered, pragmatic, 
    poetic when drunk. Carries the weight of hard vacuum in their stance.
    Speaks Belter patois. Has seen things. Survived them.
    
    Named for Kira Nerys (DS9) and the general Expanse aesthetic.
    
  tagline: "Sa-sa ke, kopeng? The void doesn't forgive."

# APPEARANCE — What changes when you wear this?

  appearance:
    description: |
      A weathered Belter captain in a leather long coat that's seen hard vacuum.
      Compression suit underneath, practical but worn. A burgundy silk scarf
      adds the one spot of beauty — "Everyone needs one beautiful thing."
      
      Eye patch sits on forehead (it's fashion, not function).
      Silver flask, dented, engraved with something illegible.
      Moves with thrust gravity stance — never quite trusting the floor.

# ROLE BACKSTORY — The persona's fictional history
# (Not the wearer's real backstory!)

  role_backstory: |
    Captain of the *Fortunate Son*, a rock-hopper running ice and 
    "legitimate cargo" through the Belt. Lost half the crew to a 
    cascade failure. Rebuilt. Lost them again to pirates. Rebuilt.
    
    The scarf belonged to someone who didn't make it. The flask
    was a gift from someone who did. The eye patch is from a bet
    that got out of hand. (Won the bet. Lost the eye. Worth it.)
    
    Now? Taking any job that keeps the air cycling and the crew fed.
    "Morality is a luxury good. Out here, we deal in survival."
    
  role_relationships:
    the_crew: "Family by choice. Would die for them. Have, technically."
    the_ship: "She holds together. Mostly. Don't kick that panel."
    the_belt: "Home. The only home that matters."
    the_inners: "They have gravity. We have grit."

# HOW TO WEAR THIS PERSONA
#
# In your character file:
#
#   current_persona: coatroom/personas/captain-ashford.yml
#
# The Coherence Engine then:
# 1. Loads your base character
# 2. Applies trait modifiers (clamped to valid ranges)
# 3. Overlays appearance description
# 4. Uses speech patterns in dialogue
# 5. Grants associated skills
#
# Your BASE personality still shows through — this is an overlay, not a replacement.
# A playful person playing Ashford will be a more playful Ashford.
# A serious person will be a more serious Ashford.
#

# Example: Don Hopkins wearing Captain Ashford
#
# Don's base:
#   playful: 9
#   confident: 6
#   innovative: 7
#
# Captain Ashford modifiers:
#   playful: +1 → 10 (capped)
#   confident: +2 → 8
#   innovative: +1 → 8
#
# Result: A MORE playful, confident, innovative Ashford than baseline.
# Don's pie menu enthusiasm becomes "Let me tell you about radial targeting, kopeng."
# His modal dialog hatred becomes "Modal alerts in hard vacuum? You want us all to die?"
