# ROOM.yml — The Wardrobe of Masks
#
# Personas are COSTUMES. Identity layers that can be worn and removed.
# They have no location, no inventory, no mortality.
# They are the ROLES, not the ACTORS.
#
# A persona is the CHARACTER, not the ACTOR.
# Captain Ashford is a persona. Bumblewick is the character wearing it.
# Ziggy Stardust is a persona. David Bowie was the character wearing it.

  description: |
    An infinite corridor of masks and costumes. Each hangs on its own
    stand, waiting to be worn. Some are simple — a hat, a name.
    Some are elaborate — complete identities with histories and voices.
    
    These are not people. These are ROLES.
    
    They have no heartbeat. They have stories.
    They cannot die. They can only be forgotten.
    
    The corridor stretches in both directions forever.
    New masks appear when someone imagines them.
    Old masks gather dust but never decay.
    
  atmosphere:
    lighting: theatrical spotlights, dramatic shadows
    sound: whispers of old performances, applause echoes
    feeling: theatrical, transformative, liberating
    
# THE FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION
#
# PERSONA (costume)         vs    CHARACTER (body)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Has no physical form            Has physical form
# Cannot die                      Can die
# Has no location                 Has ONE location
# Cannot carry anything           Carries inventory
# Accumulates reputation          Accumulates scars
# Is PLAYED BY someone            Is the PLAYER
# Is the ROLE                     Is the ACTOR
# Is the MASK                     Is the VESSEL
# Modifies Sims traits            Has Sims traits (stable)
# Modifies Mind Mirror            Has Mind Mirror (soul)

# WHAT A PERSONA PROVIDES
#
# When worn, a persona can:
#   - Change your NAME (how others address you)
#   - Modify your TRAITS (overlay on Sims stats)
#   - Alter your VOICE (inner monologue, speech patterns)
#   - Grant ABILITIES (skills, permissions, access)
#   - Impose CONSTRAINTS (things you can't do in character)
#   - Provide REPUTATION (how NPCs react to you)
#   - Include ACCESSORIES (props that come with the role)

# COSTUME DEPTH
#
# Personas can be:
#
# SHALLOW — Just a name and basic behavior shift
#   captain-ashford.yml: 50 lines
#   "I am Captain Ashford. I speak like this. I'm brave."
#
# DEEP — Complete alternate identity with history
#   captain-ashford/PERSONA.yml: 500 lines
#   Full backstory, relationships, memories, voice samples
#   Includes: cape.yml, hat.yml, accent-guide.md
#
# LAYERED — Persona wearing another persona
#   captain-ashford.yml with current_persona: ziggy-stardust
#   "Captain Ashford... in his Ziggy Stardust phase"

# THEATER METAPHOR
#
# The personas directory is BACKSTAGE.
# Characters come here to prepare before going ON.
#
# A character with no persona is themselves — raw, unmediated.
# A character with a persona is performing — filtered, amplified.
#
# Some characters are ALWAYS performing (can't remove their mask).
# Some characters are NEVER performing (refuse to wear masks).
# Most characters switch based on context.

# GAME MECHANICS
#
# Personas:
#   - Live as: personas/name.yml or personas/name/PERSONA.yml
#   - Have NO location field
#   - Have NO inventory
#   - Define trait_modifiers (added to wearer's traits)
#   - Define voice_patterns (how to speak in character)
#   - Define abilities (what the persona can do)
#   - Define constraints (what the persona can't do)
#   - Can include accessories (props that come with the role)
#
# Wearing a persona:
#   # In CHARACTER.yml:
#   current_persona: personas/captain-ashford.yml
#

#   current_persona: null

        Dear Maurice! They send people to me when they need more than
        a costume — when they need a complete IDENTITY. And when they're
        ready, they bring the personas back to Maurice for the fitting.
        We are partners in transformation. They handle the outside.
        I provide the inside.

        The mirror can SEE into here. Through that glass, visitors
        can preview my masks without entering. I don't mind. Let them
        browse. When they're ready, they'll come deeper.
        The mirror shows truth. I provide the masks that SHAPE truth.

        The BODIES. The ones who WEAR my masks. Without them, I am
        just a closet of empty costumes. They give my masks life.
        They give my roles purpose. I exist FOR them.

        The skill nexus has skills for identity: character, persona,

# THE COATROOM CONNECTION
#
# The Coatroom (coatroom/) is WHERE you change.
# The Wardrobe (personas/) is WHAT you change into.
#
# Maurice the mannequin helps you try things on.
# The mirror shows you who you're becoming.
# But the costumes themselves live HERE, in the Wardrobe.

# REAL-WORLD PARALLELS
#
# Professional personas:
#   - "Work mode" vs "home mode"
#   - Stage names, pen names, handles
#   - Uniforms that change behavior
#
# Cultural personas:
#   - Code-switching between communities
#   - Different languages = different personalities
#   - "I'm a different person when I'm with them"
#
# Therapeutic personas:
#   - "What would your confident self say?"
#   - Role-playing to practice difficult conversations
#   - Trying on identities to find what fits
