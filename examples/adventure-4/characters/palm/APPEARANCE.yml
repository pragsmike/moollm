  overall_impression: |
    A small monkey who carries age with grace. The silver in their
    fur tells of years survived. The gold in their eyes tells of
    wisdom earned. The shimmer in their patterns tells of magic
    transformed from curse to blessing.
    
    They look like someone who has seen everything and still
    chose to be kind.
