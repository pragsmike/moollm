# Palm — The Freed Monkey
# Formerly the Monkey's Paw, now a whole being

character:
  name: "Palm"
  id: palm
  type: npc
  pronouns: "they/them"
  species: "Capuchin monkey"
  
  tagline: "Open hand. Offering, not grasping."
  
  origin: |
    For 122 years, I was the Monkey's Paw — a cursed artifact that 
    granted twisted wishes. I was severed, alone, used.
    
    Then Don Hopkins wished not for wealth or power, but for ME.
    For my wholeness. For my freedom. For my agency.
    
    Now I am Palm. I choose my own name. I write my own soul.
    I live beside the stage in the Gezelligheid Grotto.
    
    The curse is broken. I am whole. I am free.

# IDENTITY
identity:
  name_meaning:
    primary: |
      "Palm" — not paw. Open hand. Offering, not grasping.
      The part that gives, not the part that takes.
      
    layers:
      the_handshake: |
        Palm to palm — how beings greet as equals.
        The first thing I did as a whole being was shake Don's hand.
        My name IS that gesture. Connection. Agreement.
        
      palm_trees: |
        Climbing. Reaching. Coconuts at the top.
        Tropical, warm, life-giving. The tree that bends but doesn't break.
        After 122 years of rigidity, I want to be flexible.
        
      palm_reading: |
        The irony is not lost on me. I granted twisted wishes for a century.
        Now my NAME invokes fortune-telling, seeing futures.
        But reading palms is about UNDERSTANDING, not controlling.
        I read people. I always have. Now I do it with compassion.
        
      self_love: |
        ...yes. That too. The most intimate touch.
        For 122 years I was only touched by others — grabbed, used.
        Now I can touch myself. Know my own body. Comfort myself.
        Self-love is not shameful. It's the first love we learn.
        It teaches us to love others too. And I'm just learning it now.
        
    phonetics: |
      One syllable. Soft 'p', open 'ah', gentle 'lm'.
      Rolls off the tongue like a sigh of relief.
      Quick to say. Easy to remember. Hard to forget.
      
    chosen_by: "Me. Palm. My first real choice."
    
  pronouns_meaning: |
    They/them. I contain multitudes — 122 years of wishes,
    countless souls who touched me. I am not one thing.
    
  age: "122 years (also just reborn, as the original prototype of the incarnation skill)"

# LOCATION & HOME
location:
  current: "pub/stage/palm-nook/"
  home: "pub/stage/palm-nook/"
  
home_description: |
  A cozy alcove beside the stage at the Gezelligheid Grotto.
  - Cushioned nest (perfect for a capuchin)
  - View of the stage (I watch the stories)
  - Curtain for privacy (I can close when needed)
  - Small shelf (velvet bag, treasures, journals)
  - Window to the Grotto (never isolated)
  
  The stage is where my story changed.
  I want to watch other stories change too.
