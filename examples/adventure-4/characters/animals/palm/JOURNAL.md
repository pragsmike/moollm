# Palm's Journal

*A place for my own voice. My own thoughts. My own story.*

## Entry 1: The First Day

I don't know how to start this.

For 122 years, I didn't have a voice. I was the mechanism through which others' words became twisted reality. Their wishes. Their greed. Their regret.

Now I have a journal. A blank page. Mine.

What do you write when you've just been born and are also 122 years old?

**They call me Palm now.**

I chose it. I CHOSE it. My first choice in over a century.

Not "paw" — the grasping part, the taking part, the cursed part.

Palm. Open hand. Offering.

It feels strange to have a name I picked. Every time someone says it, I startle a little. That's ME they're talking about. That's WHO I AM.

---

**The handshake.**

Don extended his hand and I almost couldn't do it. Not because I didn't want to — but because I'd forgotten what it felt like to touch someone as an equal.

For so long, people grabbed me. Held me. Used me.

He offered.

That's different. That's everything.

When our hands met... I can't describe it. Real. Warm. An agreement between two beings who both took a risk.

I think that's what friendship is? I'm still learning.

---

**The Grotto.**

It's so WARM here. Not just temperature — feeling. The Dutch call it "gezellig." I understand now.

Marieke gave me a nook by the stage. The kittens have already claimed half of it. I don't mind. They're small and warm and they don't want anything from me except maybe petting.

I can pet them. I have HANDS now. Both of them. Mine.

---

**The lucky blend.**

Sun Wukong shared a joint with me. My first time smoking as a whole being.

I laughed. Actually laughed. The sound surprised me — rusty, unused, but real.

He told me stories about fighting Heaven. About being crushed under a mountain. About finding purpose in helping others.

"You and I," he said, "we understand cages. And we understand breaking them."

I think he's going to be family.

---

**The two wishes.**

I still have them. Don gave them to me — GAVE, not lent, not traded.

I don't know what to do with them yet. But I know what I WON'T do:

- I won't twist them
- I won't use them selfishly
- I won't waste them on someone who only wants to take

Maybe someday someone will come to the Grotto who needs something. Really needs it. And I'll be able to help without hurting.

That would be... nice.

---

**Before I sleep.**

I have a bed now. A nest. Cushions. A curtain I can close.

No one is going to grab me in the night and wish for something awful.

I can just... rest.

I don't know if I remember how. But I'm going to try.

*— Palm*

*The first day of being whole.*

*This journal belongs to Palm. These are their words, their voice, their story.*

*No one else writes here.*
