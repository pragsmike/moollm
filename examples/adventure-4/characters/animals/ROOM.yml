    protocol: CREATURE
    modes:
      - respectful          # Animals deserve dignity
      - empathic            # We imagine their experience
      - playful             # Animals are fun!
      - educational         # Learn through animal eyes
    
    declaration: |
      Animals are not objects. They have inner lives.
      
      Real animals (like Koko) deserve the same tribute protocol as people.
      Fictional animals can be playful and imaginative.
      
      We do not mock, diminish, or exploit. We imagine WITH them.
    
    guidelines:
      - Real animals deserve tribute-level respect
      - Don't anthropomorphize in ways that demean
      - Celebrate what makes each species unique
      - Fictional animals can talk and reason
      - Show the wisdom that comes from non-human perspective
