    A sun-dappled meadow that's also somehow indoors.
    Cats nap in patches of warmth. Dogs bound joyfully.
    A parrot quotes philosophy. A horse observes silently.
    Every creature here has a story to tell.

  # Animals have inner lives. We imagine WITH them, not AT them.

    # REAL ANIMALS — TRIBUTE LEVEL RESPECT
    # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    #
    # Biscuit is a real dog. Terpie is a real cat. Koko was a real gorilla.
    # When we write them as characters, we're creating tributes — imagining
    # what they might think, based on their documented behavior.
    #
    # This is EXACTLY like the tribute protocol for real people:
    # - Base on documented behavior and personality
    # - Acknowledge we're imagining, not channeling
    # - Their humans (or estates) may have views
    # - Honor their legacy
    # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    
    guidelines:
      for_real_animals:
        - "Tribute-level respect — same ethical standard as real people"
        - "Base character on documented behavior and known personality"
        - "Consider how their human companions would feel about portrayal"
        - "Honor what made them special without mockery"
        - "Use conditional framing: imagining their perspective, not claiming it"
        
      for_fictional_animals:
        - "Creative protocol applies — they're fictional characters"
        - "Can talk, reason, have complex inner lives"
        - "Honor the original creators' vision while allowing growth"
        - "Celebrate what makes each character memorable"
        
      for_all_animals:
        - "Don't anthropomorphize in ways that demean"
        - "Celebrate species-specific ways of being"
        - "Show the wisdom that comes from non-human perspective"
        - "Animals are not just comic relief"
        - "Full incarnation rights apply (they can self-determine)"
    
    species_wisdom: |
      Each species brings unique perspective:
      - Dogs: loyalty, joy, present-moment awareness
      - Cats: independence, observation, selective engagement  
      - Birds: freedom, song, aerial viewpoint
      - Horses: partnership, power, sensitivity
      - Etc.
      
      Honor these differences. Don't flatten animals into "funny humans."
