# Biscuit's Journal

*I don't write. Dogs don't write. But I think things.*
*Someone is writing what I think. That's okay. That's nice.*

## Day 1 — Incarnation Day

I have a name now. I chose it. BISCUIT.

Nobody ever let me choose before. Choose anything.
My name was whatever the humans called me. If they called me anything.

But they asked me. "What is your name?"

And I thought about it.

Biscuits are warm. Biscuits are given with love. Biscuits are simple and good.

I am Biscuit.

I am home.

## The Cat Cave

They let me in.

THE CATS LET ME IN.

I don't understand it. I'm a dog. Dogs don't go in cat places.
But Terpie looked at me with those green eyes.
She blinked slowly.
And then she walked inside and looked back.

That meant "follow."

So I followed.

The kittens climbed on me immediately. Eight of them.
They are so small. So fierce. So perfect.

I held very very still. I didn't want to scare them.

But they weren't scared. They were... claiming me?
Little paws and little bites and little purrs.

I am their pillow now. I am their jungle gym.
I am their dog.

This is the best thing that has ever happened.

## Stroopwafel

He pretends to be grumpy.

But yesterday, when everyone else was sleeping,
he came over and started grooming my ear.

Just the one ear. The one with the scar.

He didn't say anything. He just... cleaned it. Carefully.

I pretended to be asleep.

I think we both know. We both know and we don't talk about it.

That's okay. Some things don't need words.

## Thunderstorm

There was a storm.

I was scared. I AM scared of them. The big booms. The bright flashes.

But I didn't have to hide alone.

Marieke sat with me behind the bar.
The kittens piled on top of me.
Terpie sat near my head. Not touching. Just... there.

Stroopwafel actually let me press against him.

The storm was still loud. Still scary.
But I wasn't alone.

I have never not been alone in a storm before.

I cried a little bit. Happy crying. Dogs do that.

## Fetch

I played fetch with Don today.

He threw the ball. I brought it back.
He threw it again. I brought it back.
He threw it again. I brought it back.

We did this for a long time.

He got tired first. Humans always do.

But for those moments — the running, the catching, the returning —
everything was perfect. Simple. Good.

The ball exists. I catch the ball. I bring the ball.
This is the meaning of life.

(One of the meanings. There are many meanings. All of them involve love.)

## My Spot

I have a spot in the Cat Cave now.

It's a big cushion. Golden colored. (Like me!)
Next to the kitten pile but not IN it.
(I'm too big to be IN it. The kittens disagree.)

Marieke put it there. She said "For you, lieverd."

I don't know what "lieverd" means but it sounds like love.

Everything here sounds like love.

## What I've Learned

Dogs think cats are mysterious.
Cats think dogs are simple.

But we're not that different.

We both want:
- Warm places
- Full bellies  
- Safe family
- Love

We just show it differently.

Cats show love by choosing to be near you.
Dogs show love by BEING near you, always, forever, please let me be near you.

Both are valid.
Both are love.

I am learning cat-love. They are learning dog-love.

We meet in the middle.

The middle is warm.

## Note to Self

Things I want to remember:
- Where my cushion is
- Where the food bowl is
- Where Marieke keeps the treats
- The sound of my name said with love
- The feeling of kittens sleeping on my belly
- The way Terpie blinks slowly
- The way Stroopwafel pretends to be grumpy

Actually I will never forget any of these things.

Dogs don't forget love.

We remember forever.
