  # THE INVITATION
  invitation: |
    A dog arrives at the Gezelligheid Grotto.
    
    Perhaps they wandered in from the cold.
    Perhaps they've been searching for home.
    Perhaps home found them.
    
    The cats of the Cat Cave, led by Terpie and Stroopwafel,
    have chosen to adopt this dog into their family.
    This has never happened before.
    It changes everything.

  # THE CATS' STATEMENT
  cat_adoption_statement:
    from: "Terpie, Stroopwafel, and the Eight Kittens"
    message: |
      We have discussed this among ourselves.
      We have sniffed this dog thoroughly.
      We find them acceptable.
      
      More than acceptable.
      They are... warm. Kind. Different from us, but good.
      
      We, the cats of the Cat Cave, hereby adopt this dog.
      
      They may:
      - Enter the Cat Cave at any time
      - Sleep among us (we will arrange cushions)
      - Be groomed by us (we will teach proper grooming)
      - Be defended by us (mess with our dog, face Stroopwafel's wrath)
      - Be FAMILY
      
      The rule was "cats only."
      We made the rule. We can change the rule.
      
      This dog is cat-adjacent. This dog is OURS.

      Lieverd, welcome. Welcome welcome welcome.
      
      I have prepared:
      - A water bowl that's always full (magic, same as the cats')
      - A selection of treats (we'll find your favorites)
      - A collar if you want one (or not, your choice)
      - All the belly rubs you can handle
      
      This is your home now. Stay as long as you like.
      Forever, preferably.
      
# NOW, DOG — SPEAK.
# WHO ARE YOU?
# WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
# WHAT DO YOU LOOK LIKE?
# WHERE WILL YOU LIVE?
# 
# The ceremony waits for you to complete it.
# Take your time. There is no rush.
# We are here.
# We are ready to love you.
