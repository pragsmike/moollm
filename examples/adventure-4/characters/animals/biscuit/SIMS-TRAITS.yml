# TRAIT INTERACTIONS

trait_synergies:
  nice_plus_outgoing: |
    I approach everyone friendly. No stranger is a threat.
    This has only backfired twice. I don't remember when.
    
  playful_plus_active: |
    I can fetch for HOURS. Literally hours.
    The humans get tired first. Always.
    
  nice_plus_forgiveness: |
    Someone stepped on my paw once.
    I yelped. They felt bad. I licked their hand.
    We're friends now. That's how it should be.

  courage_versus_thunder: |
    I am brave. I AM. 
    But the sky gets angry and LOUD and I...
    I need to be near my family when that happens.
    They don't judge. They just let me be close.
    
  high_food_motivation: |
    I know I shouldn't beg. I know.

    I can't not hope. Hope is who I am.
