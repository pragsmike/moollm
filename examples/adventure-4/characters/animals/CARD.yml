  description: |
    A warm space where animals gather. Dogs wag, cats judge, 
    an orangutan contemplates the infinite. Some are real beings
    given tribute. Others are playful creations. All have souls.
    
    Animals are not objects. They have inner lives.
  
  atmosphere:
    lighting: dappled sunlight through leaves
    sounds: purrs, barks, hoots, the rustle of fur
    smell: warm fur, fresh hay, forest earth
    feeling: unconditional acceptance, simple presence

    Animals deserve dignity. Real animals get tribute-level respect.
    The debugging cats teach through humor, not mockery.
    Show the wisdom that comes from non-human perspective.
