# 🐾 Animal Companions

> *"Animals are not objects. They have inner lives."*

Sunlight dapples through leaves. You smell warm fur and fresh earth. A golden retriever bounds toward you, tail wagging so hard his whole body wiggles. An orangutan watches from a hammock, wise eyes seeing more than you'd expect.

In the corner, a pile of cats debates programming errors in meows. One points at nothing and causes a segfault. Another chases its tail infinitely. A grumpy one sits in a too-small box, overflowing with attitude.

These are **creatures with souls** -- some real beings given tribute, others playful creations, all deserving of dignity.

## Ethical Protocol: CREATURE

Animals deserve respect:
- Real animals (like Koko) get tribute-level care
- Don't anthropomorphize in ways that demean
- Celebrate what makes each species unique
- **Show the wisdom that comes from non-human perspective**
