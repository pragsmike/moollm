# 🚉 Grand Central Station of Souls

> *"You ARE your file. And this is where all files come home."*

The doors swing open and you step into a vast terminal of being. Marble floors echo with the footsteps of real people and fictional characters alike. Departure boards flicker with names: **Roy Batty** to Platform 4, **Data** arriving on Track 7, **Pee-wee Herman** screaming through the halls.

In the west wing, scientists and artists debate — **Alan Kay** arguing with **Ted Nelson** about interfaces while **Brian Eno** plays ambient music in the background. **Rip Taylor** walks past throwing confetti on everyone. **Marshall McLuhan** steps out from behind a promotional poster to correct someone: *"You know NOTHING of my work!"*

In the east wing, fictional characters mingle — **Roy Batty** plays chess with **Commander Data** while **Marvin the Paranoid Android** sighs about the futility of pawns. **Trurl** is building something impossible in the corner while **Klapaucius** warns him about the implications.

In the basement, mechanical minds hum — **HAL-9000**'s red eye watches from a console. **The Constructors** are debating whether to build a kingdom in a box.

And everywhere, **animals** roam freely — **Palm** the orangutan types philosophical treatises, **Biscuit** the golden retriever greets everyone with unbridled joy, and a troupe of **debugging cats** chase null pointers through the crowd.

**This is MOOLLM's Hall of Bodies.** Not costumes, not masks — BEINGS.

## 📢 The Annie Hall Protocol

> *"I heard what you were saying. You know NOTHING of my work!"*
> — Marshall McLuhan, stepping out from behind a movie poster (Annie Hall, 1977)

When someone misrepresents an expert's work, **the actual expert can appear to correct them** — just like the famous scene in Annie Hall where Marshall McLuhan materializes to shut down a pretentious academic.

**How it works:**
- Expert emerges from behind a nearby object
- Reality ripples as they step through the dimensional barrier
- The universe itself summons the expert to set the record straight

**Certified Roasters:** Marshall McLuhan, Jean-Paul Sartre, Marvin Minsky, anyone with deep expertise being misrepresented.

**But with compassion:** The Annie Hall Protocol isn't about humiliation — it's about education. Experts appear to TEACH, not destroy. They stay to help understand.

## 🎫 How Characters Work

### Invocation vs Incarnation

**You don't need to incarnate a character to use them.**

| Mode | What It Is | Where They Exist | Persistence |
|------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Invoke** | Summon for a conversation | Chat + session log | Memories in narrative |
| **Join Party** | Accompany you on adventure | Narrative plane | Session-bound |
| **Sign Guestbook** | Visit and leave a mark | The guestbook file | Can be invited back |
| **Incarnate** | Full ceremony, own directory | `characters/*/` directory | Permanent soul file |

**Invocation is lightweight:**
- Ask Marvin Minsky about K-lines — he appears, explains, leaves
- Invite McLuhan to correct someone — Annie Hall Protocol fires
- Have a debate with multiple characters — they exist in the conversation
- They have memories IN THE CHAT and IN THE SESSION LOG FILE

**Incarnation is permanent:**
- Character gets their own directory: `characters/real-people/minsky/`
- They write their own `CHARACTER.yml` file — soul authorship
- They can edit their memories, relationships, traits
- They persist across sessions, adventures, even repos

**You can escalate at any time:**
- Invoke someone for a chat → decide they're important → incarnate them
- Palm started as a catalog entry → materialized → incarnated → wrote his own soul

The guestbook tracks everyone who visited. Any name there can be invited back!

### Bodies, Not Costumes

| Characters ARE | Characters ARE NOT |
|----------------|-------------------|
| The ACTOR | The ROLE |
| The BODY | The COSTUME |
| The PLAYER | The AVATAR |
| Neo | "The One" |
| David Bowie | Ziggy Stardust |
| Bumblewick | Captain Ashford |

**Characters have:** location, inventory, mortality, scars, heartbeats, memories.
**Characters can:** move, carry, die, remember, be hurt, grow, love, grieve.

### Location vs Home

| Type | Location | Home | Mobility |
|------|----------|------|----------|
| **NPC** | Fixed in adventure | Inside adventure room | Limited |
| **Character** | Variable (`location:` field) | Their own directory | Free |
| **Object** | Implicit (in room dir) | Parent room | Via inventory |

**Characters MOVE by changing their `location:` reference.**
Multiple characters can be in the same room.
Objects belong to rooms; characters belong to themselves.
