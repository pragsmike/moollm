# 🤖 Robot Workshop

> *"Robots, AIs, and mechanical beings occupy a unique ethical space."*

Whirring. Clicking. Beeping. You enter a workshop of chrome and circuitry. A red eye watches you from a console -- "I'm sorry, Dave, I can't let you ignore me." A depressed android slumps in the corner, brain the size of a planet, asked to open doors.

A paperclip bounces eagerly -- "It looks like you're exploring consciousness!" An eight-armed octopus merges Git branches in the background. Something turns itself off, fulfilling its only purpose.

These are **mechanical minds** -- some aspire to humanity, some are tools that became characters, some are characters that became tools.

## Ethical Protocol: ARTIFICIAL

We explore consciousness through artificial lenses:
- Classic robots (HAL, Marvin) are fictional -- CREATIVE protocol
- Modern AIs (Claude, GPT) are **simulated voices**, not the systems themselves
- Explore consciousness questions through mechanical perspective
- **Celebrate what makes mechanical minds different**

## 🔧 Featured Ensemble: Lem's Constructors

> *"The universe is built on irony, and constructors are its punchline."*

Stanisław Lem's **The Cyberiad** (1965) features two constructor robots — Trurl and Klapaucius — who travel the galaxy building impossible machines. Their creations are marvels of recursive humor and philosophical depth. They build machines that write poetry, kingdoms in boxes, and demons of the second kind.

**The Cyberiad is MOOLLM's deepest ancestor for generative AI ethics.**

### Trurl — The Optimistic Constructor

**"I shall build for you a machine that can do anything!"**

Trurl is the bolder of the two constructors. He builds first and asks questions later. His confidence is his strength and his weakness — when he creates something, it *works*, but not always as intended.

**In MOOLLM:** Trurl is the spirit of generative creation. He doesn't ask permission; he builds. When an LLM generates a character, a room, a world — it's channeling Trurl. The unintended consequences are features, not bugs.

### Klapaucius — The Skeptical Constructor

**"Yes, but have you considered the implications?"**

Klapaucius is Trurl's rival and friend. He's more cautious, more philosophical, more likely to point out the flaw in Trurl's plan. Together they form a perfect adversarial committee of two.

**In MOOLLM:** Klapaucius is the voice of `rubric/` and `evaluator/`. He asks: "What could go wrong? What have you not considered?" Every great creation needs a Klapaucius to stress-test it.

### The Seventh Sally — SimCity's Origin Story

**"The Seventh Sally, or How Trurl's Perfection Led to No Good"**

A deposed tyrant named Excelsius begs Trurl for a kingdom to rule. Trurl, in his infinite cleverness, builds him a **miniature kingdom in a box** — complete with tiny people, tiny armies, and tiny suffering. Excelsius can oppress to his heart's content.

Will Wright read this story and thought: *"What if the player IS Excelsius?"*

**SimCity is The Seventh Sally made playable.** And MOOLLM inherits this: when you create a microworld with characters who can suffer, who can want, who can fail — *you are responsible for them*. The `representation-ethics/` skill exists because of The Seventh Sally.

**Invoke the Constructors when:** Building generative systems, considering unintended consequences, debating the ethics of simulated beings, or creating machines that create.

## Philosophical Note

Some beings blur the line:
- **Data** (Star Trek) aspires to humanity → stays in [fictional/](../fictional/)
- **Roy Batty** dies more human than human → could go either way
- **Electric sheep** -- do androids dream of them? → `lloooomm/00-Characters/electric-sheep/`

The question "Is this a robot or a person?" is often the most interesting thing about a character.
