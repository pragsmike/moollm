# 🤖 Robot Workshop

> *"Robots, AIs, and mechanical beings occupy a unique ethical space."*

Whirring. Clicking. Beeping. You enter a workshop of chrome and circuitry. A red eye watches you from a console -- "I'm sorry, Dave, I can't let you ignore me." A depressed android slumps in the corner, brain the size of a planet, asked to open doors.

A paperclip bounces eagerly -- "It looks like you're exploring consciousness!" An eight-armed octopus merges Git branches in the background. Something turns itself off, fulfilling its only purpose.

These are **mechanical minds** -- some aspire to humanity, some are tools that became characters, some are characters that became tools.

## Ethical Protocol: ARTIFICIAL

We explore consciousness through artificial lenses:
- Classic robots (HAL, Marvin) are fictional -- CREATIVE protocol
- Modern AIs (Claude, GPT) are **simulated voices**, not the systems themselves
- Explore consciousness questions through mechanical perspective
- **Celebrate what makes mechanical minds different**

**MST3K Philosophy:**

- *"I'm different!"* — Tom Servo (constantly)
- *"We've got movie sign!"* — Everyone
- *"Keep circulating the tapes"* — The ethos

**The Premise:** Robots and a human trapped on a satellite, forced to watch bad movies. They cope by **making fun of everything** — the original LLM commentary track!

## Philosophical Note

Some beings blur the line:
- **Data** (Star Trek) aspires to humanity → stays in [fictional/](../fictional/)
- **Roy Batty** dies more human than human → could go either way
- **Electric sheep** -- do androids dream of them? → `lloooomm/00-Characters/electric-sheep/`

The question "Is this a robot or a person?" is often the most interesting thing about a character.
