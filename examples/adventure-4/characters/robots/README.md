# Robot Workshop

> *"Robots, AIs, and mechanical beings occupy a unique ethical space."*

Mechanical minds, digital beings, and artificial intelligences. Some aspire to be human. Some are tools that became characters. Some are characters that became tools.

## Ethical Protocol: ARTIFICIAL

We explore consciousness, autonomy, and identity through artificial lenses. Real AI systems are simulated voices, not the systems themselves.

## Philosophical Note

Some beings blur the line:
- **Data** (Star Trek) aspires to humanity → stays in [fictional/](../fictional/)
- **Roy Batty** dies more human than human → could go either way
- **Electric sheep** -- do androids dream of them? → `lloooomm/00-Characters/electric-sheep/`

The question "Is this a robot or a person?" is often the most interesting thing about a character.
