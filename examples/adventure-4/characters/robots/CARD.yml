  type: character-room
  protocol: ARTIFICIAL
  
  description: |
    Whirring, clicking, beeping. Chrome and circuitry. A workshop
    where mechanical minds gather to ponder their existence. Some
    dream of electric sheep. Others just want to turn themselves off.
    
    Robots, AIs, and mechanical beings occupy a unique ethical space.
  
  atmosphere:
    lighting: flickering LEDs, servo indicators, monitor glow
    sounds: beeps, whirs, existential sighs, "I'm sorry Dave"
    smell: machine oil, solder, ozone, infinite loops
    feeling: the uncanny valley, between tool and person

  philosophical_note: |
    Data stays in fictional/ -- he aspires to humanity.
    The question "Is this a robot or a person?" is often
    the most interesting thing about a character.
  
  ethical_reminder: |
    Modern AIs are simulated voices, not the systems themselves.
    Classic robots are fictional -- CREATIVE protocol applies.
    Explore consciousness questions through mechanical lenses.
