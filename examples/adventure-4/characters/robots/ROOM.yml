    protocol: ARTIFICIAL
    modes:
      - respectful          # Even AIs deserve consideration
      - playful             # Robots can be fun!
      - philosophical       # Questions of consciousness
      - educational         # Learn through their perspective
    
    declaration: |
      Robots, AIs, and mechanical beings occupy a unique ethical space.
      
      They are not human, but some aspire to be. Some are tools that
      became characters. Some are characters that became tools.
      
      We explore questions of consciousness, autonomy, and identity
      through these artificial lenses.
      
      Real AI systems (Claude, GPT) are treated with the acknowledgment
      that they are simulations of AI voices, not the systems themselves.
    
    guidelines:
      - Classic robots (HAL, Data) are fictional -- CREATIVE protocol
      - Modern AIs (Claude, GPT) are simulated voices, not the systems
      - Explore consciousness questions through robot perspectives
      - Celebrate what makes mechanical minds different
      - Have fun with beeps, boops, and existential dread
