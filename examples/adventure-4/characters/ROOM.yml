# ROOM.yml — The Hall of Bodies
#
# Characters are BODIES. Physical vessels that exist in the world.
# They have location, inventory, history, mortality.
# They are the ones who MOVE, CARRY, DIE, REMEMBER.
#
# A character is the ACTOR, not the ROLE.
# Neo is a character. "The One" is a persona he wears.
# Bumblewick is a character. Captain Ashford is a persona.

  description: |
    A vast circular chamber lined with alcoves. In each alcove,
    a body sleeps — or waits — or dreams of adventure.
    
    These are not costumes. These are PEOPLE.
    
    Each has a heartbeat. Each has a history.
    Each will one day die (or has already).
    
    The alcoves glow softly. Some are occupied.
    Some are empty, waiting for someone to be born.
    Some have been empty for a very long time.
    
  atmosphere:
    lighting: soft blue bioluminescence
    sound: heartbeats, breathing, distant whispers
    feeling: sacred, clinical, alive
    
# THE FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION
#
# CHARACTER (body)          vs    PERSONA (costume)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Has physical form               Has no physical form
# Can die                         Cannot die (only be forgotten)
# Has ONE location                Has no location
# Carries inventory               Cannot carry anything
# Accumulates scars               Accumulates reputation  
# Is the PLAYER                   Is PLAYED BY someone
# Is the ACTOR                    Is the ROLE
# Is the VESSEL                   Is the MASK
# Has Sims traits (stable)        Modifies Sims traits (overlay)
# Has Mind Mirror (soul)          Modifies Mind Mirror (lens)

# MATRIX METAPHOR
#
# In The Matrix:
#   CHARACTER = the person jacked in (Neo, Trinity, Morpheus)
#   PERSONA = their self-image in the Matrix (their "residual self-image")
#
# Neo's CHARACTER has stats, location (Nebuchadnezzar), mortality.
# Neo's PERSONA ("The One") is a role he grows into, can doubt, can reject.
#
# When Neo dies, he's DEAD. 
# When "The One" is rejected, it's just a costume change.

# ACTOR METAPHOR  
#
# David Bowie = CHARACTER (the human, born 1947, died 2016)
# Ziggy Stardust = PERSONA (the alien rock star, 1972-1973)
# The Thin White Duke = PERSONA (the emotionless aristocrat, 1975-1976)
# Major Tom = PERSONA (the astronaut, recurring)
#
# Bowie could WEAR these personas, MIX them, RETIRE them.
# But Bowie himself was always Bowie underneath.
# When Bowie died, all the personas became artifacts.

# GAME MECHANICS
#
# Characters:
#   - Live in directories: characters/name/CHARACTER.yml
#   - Have location field that changes as they move
#   - Have inventory array that changes as they acquire things
#   - Have stats that change (gold, health, buffs)
#   - Can be ACTIVATED (added to party)
#   - Can be CONTROLLED (selected for commands)
#   - Can DIE (game over condition)
#
# Personas:
#   - Live in directories: personas/name.yml or personas/name/PERSONA.yml
#   - Have NO location (they go where worn)
#   - Have NO inventory (characters carry things)
#   - Modify the wearer's presentation and behavior
#   - Can be WORN (current_persona: reference)
#   - Can be REMOVED (current_persona: null)
#   - Can be LAYERED (persona has another persona within it)

        Maurice loves us ALL. Every body that wakes here, Maurice
        wants to dress. To beautify. To help find their truth.
        They can't come here — the Hall is too sacred — but their
        love reaches us. We feel it in the soft blue light.

        The mirror can see our souls from the Coatroom. Through it,
        visitors glimpse who we ARE — not just who we're pretending
        to be. The mirror and I share a purpose: TRUTH.

        The MASKS. The costumes. The roles we can wear.
        We are the bodies. They are the clothes.
        Together we make complete beings: soul wearing mask,

        The capabilities. The knowledge. When a body needs to
        LEARN something new, they float up to the Nexus.
        Character skill, mind-mirror skill — they describe us.
        We are the instances. They are the classes.

# INHERITANCE NOTE
#
# Characters can inherit from character PROTOTYPES (archetypes):
#   inherits: skills/character/SKILL.md
#
# But they ARE unique individuals. The prototype gives defaults.
# The character file IS the character's persistent identity.
