# Abstract Entities

> *"Ideas given voice. Concepts with personality."*

Personified concepts, mascots, AI personas, and original creations that exist because imagination allows it.

## Ethical Protocol: CONCEPTUAL

These are allegorical, playful, and experimental. No real people or trademarked characters -- just pure imagination.
