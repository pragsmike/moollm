    protocol: CONCEPTUAL
    modes:
      - allegorical         # Ideas given voice
      - playful             # Whimsical personification
      - educational         # Teaching through character
      - experimental        # Novel forms of being
    
    declaration: |
      These entities are PERSONIFIED CONCEPTS, MASCOTS, and ORIGINAL CREATIONS.
      They are not representations of real people or existing fictional characters.
      
      They may embody:
      - Abstract ideas (Truth, Consciousness, Time)
      - Technical concepts (Null Pointer, Stack Overflow)
      - Collective identities (AI systems, organizations)
      - Original creations for this world
      
      They exist because imagination allows it.
    
    guidelines:
      - Embrace the absurd -- concepts can have personalities
      - Use personification to teach technical ideas
      - Let mascots be playful and memorable
      - Original creations are yours to define
      - Have fun with the impossible
