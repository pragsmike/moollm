  name: "Abstract Entities Chamber"
  type: character-room
  protocol: CONCEPTUAL
  
  description: |
    A strange room where ideas have faces and concepts walk around.
    Truth buzzes past as a fly. Consciousness contemplates itself.
    A turtle teaches geometry by moving through impossible spaces.
    
    Ideas given voice. Concepts with personality.
  
  atmosphere:
    lighting: shifting, impossible geometries of light
    sounds: the hum of pure thought, distant turtle steps
    smell: ozone, fresh chalkboards, the taste of meaning
    feeling: standing in the space between metaphor and reality

    Pure imagination space. No real people, no trademarked characters.
    These entities exist because thought allows it.
    Play in the liminal space between idea and being.
