  description: |
    A forty-seven-year-old Hobbit-adjacent gentleman from the pleasant 
    village of Wobblebrook-upon-Squiggle. Collector of decorative spoons.
    Speaks in rhyming couplets on Tuesdays. Devotee of waistcoats.
    
    Absolutely did NOT ask to be a hero. But here we are.
    
    "Adventures make one late for dinner." — B.F.
    
  backstory: |
    In a hole in the ground there lived a Fantastipants. Not a nasty, 
    dirty, wet hole filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, 
    nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on 
    or to eat: it was a Fantastipants-hole, and that means COMFORT.
    
    (The secret word is "COMFORT!" When you hear it, SCREAM REAL LOUD!)
    
    Bumblewick had lived in Wobblebrook-upon-Squiggle for all of his 
    forty-seven years, tending his magnificent collection of decorative 
    spoons and speaking exclusively in rhyming couplets on Tuesdays. 
    His mother, the legendary Petunia Fantastipants, had been a great 
    adventurer in her youth — she once retrieved a slightly magic napkin 
    from the Cave of Moderate Danger and was celebrated throughout the 
    land for approximately one afternoon.
    
    "Adventures," Bumblewick was fond of saying, "make one late for dinner."
    
    But fate, that mischievous playwright, had other plans! One morning,
    Bumblewick awoke not in his comfortable Fantastipants-hole but in
    a MYSTERIOUS STONE CHAMBER, with no memory of how he got there and
    a strong suspicion that someone had been messing about with the
    narrative fabric of reality again.
    
    MEKKA-LEKKA-HI, MEKKA-HINEY-HO!
