    A cozy lounge where fictional characters relax between adventures.
    Replicants play chess with starship engineers. Cartoon mice chat
    with paranoid androids. Comedy legends swap bits in the corner.
    
    We play in shared imagination space.
  
  atmosphere:
    lighting: warm and eclectic, neon signs and firelight
    sounds: theme songs, catchphrases, dramatic pauses
    smell: buttered popcorn, starship recycled air, cartoon ink
    feeling: the thrill of meeting your heroes from the screen
