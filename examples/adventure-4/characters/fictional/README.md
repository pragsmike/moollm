# 🎭 Fictional Characters Lounge

> *"We play in shared imagination space."*

You push through velvet curtains into a warm lounge. Neon signs flicker with catchphrases. Movie posters cover the walls. In the corner, Roy Batty plays chess with Data while Marvin sighs about the futility of it all.

Scotty argues with HAL-9000 about the laws of physics. Zaphod Beeblebrox is being interviewed by Triumph the Insult Comic Dog. Pee-wee Herman and Linda Richman are having coffee -- they're both a little verklempt.

These are our **shared cultural touchstones** -- characters who live in collective imagination, brought here for new adventures.

Transformative, non-commercial fan engagement:
