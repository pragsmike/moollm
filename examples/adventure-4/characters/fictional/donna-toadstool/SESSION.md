# 🎭 PART ONE: CHARACTER CREATION 🎭

<details open>
<summary><strong>🚀 Prologue: BOOT — The Coherence Engine awakens</strong></summary>

## Prologue: BOOT

*The player types a single word into the void.*

> **PLAYER:** `BOOT`

The Coherence Engine awakens. This is how every MOOLLM session begins — the LLM reads the configuration files, loads the world state, and enters the adventure.

<details>
<summary>📂 <strong>Under the hood: Reading startup files, loading ADVENTURE.yml, activating K-line protocols</strong></summary>

```yaml
boot_sequence:
  files_read:
    - ../../../../startup.yml           # Default boot configuration
    - ../../../../PROTOCOLS.yml         # K-line symbol registry
    - ../../../ADVENTURE.yml            # World state (THIS is the simulation)
    - ../../../start/ROOM.yml           # Starting room definition
    - ../abstract/player/CHARACTER.yml  # Player template
    
  protocols_activated:
    - POSTEL           # Be liberal in what you accept
    - YAML-JAZZ        # Comments carry meaning
    - SPEED-OF-LIGHT   # Minimal file I/O, maximum coherence
    - MINSKY-FRAMES    # Context as crystallized thought
    
  status: INITIALIZED
```

The LLM reads [`../../../ADVENTURE.yml`](../../../ADVENTURE.yml) to understand the world state. This file IS the simulation — not a description of it, but the actual running state.

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🏛️ Turn 0: The Chamber of Commencement — Player awakens in start/</strong></summary>

## Turn 0: The Chamber of Commencement

The player awakens in [start/](../../../start/) — the Chamber of Commencement. A sacred space carved from living rock, soft sourceless light suffusing the chamber. The walls bear scratched initials of adventurers past:

> `"WC+DW '76"` — Will Crowther & Don Woods  
> `"SA '78"` — Scott Adams  
> `"CA '26"` — Captain Ashford, Grue Slayer

<details>
<summary>📂 <strong>Room definition: start/ROOM.yml showing exits to maze, pub, kitchen, coatroom, and home</strong></summary>

```yaml
# From ../../../start/ROOM.yml
room:
  name: "The Chamber of Commencement"
  
  objects:
    - lamp.yml      # The sacred GET LAMP tradition
    - mailbox.yml   # Adventure mail system
    
  exits:
    north: ../maze/room-a/   # Grue territory (DANGER)
    south: ../pub/           # The Rusty Lantern
    west: ../kitchen/        # Mother's note awaits  
    east: ../coatroom/       # Costumes and transformation
    up: ../home/             # The surface world
```

Room directories contain `ROOM.yml` plus `.yml` files for each object. The filesystem IS the spatial layout.

</details>

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 Turn 1: GET LAMP, GO EAST — The sacred command, entering the Coatroom</strong></summary>

## Turn 1: GET LAMP, GO EAST

> **PLAYER:** `get lamp, then go east`

*The most sacred command in interactive fiction.*

The [brass lamp](../../../start/lamp.yml) settles into inventory with the weight of tradition. Its base is covered in tiny scratched initials — marks of those who faced the darkness and returned.

Through velvet curtains, into the [Fantastipants Costume Emporium](../../../coatroom/).

<details>
<summary>📂 <strong>State changes: Adding lamp to CHARACTER.yml inventory, updating location from start/ to coatroom/</strong></summary>

```yaml
# GET LAMP — Object state updated, character inventory updated
state_change_1:
  file: ../../../start/lamp.yml
  change: state.location: "inventory", state.owner: "donna-toadstool"
  
  file: ./CHARACTER.yml  # Character owns their inventory
  change: player.inventory: [brass-lamp]

# GO EAST — Character's location is in their own file
state_change_2:
  file: ./CHARACTER.yml  # Character owns their location
  change: player.location: start/ → coatroom/
  
  # ADVENTURE.yml also updated for convenience/caching
  file: ../../../ADVENTURE.yml
  change: player.location: coatroom/  # Mirrors CHARACTER.yml
```

Characters own their own state — location, inventory, traits. ADVENTURE.yml has convenience references but CHARACTER.yml is canonical.

</details>

The [Coatroom](../../../coatroom/) sprawls before us. Racks spiral in concentric circles like a fabric tornado frozen in time. Feathers rustle. Sequins wink. The costumes whisper:

> *"Wear me. WEAR ME. WEAR MEEEE."*

In the center: [The Mind Mirror](../../../coatroom/mirror.yml). Beside it: [Maurice the Magnificent](../../../coatroom/mannequin.yml), the wooden mannequin fashion consultant.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🪞 Turn 2: LOOK IN MIRROR — The Mind Mirror reveals a blank prototype</strong></summary>

## Turn 2: LOOK IN MIRROR

> **PLAYER:** `look in mirror`

The Mind Mirror shows not just reflection — but ESSENCE. It revealed... nothing specific. A blank slate. Perfectly balanced. Perfectly undefined. All personality traits at midpoint.

<details>
<summary>📂 <strong>Mirror reflection: Player was using abstract/player template — all Sims traits at 5, all Mind Mirror dimensions at 4</strong></summary>

```yaml
# From ../../../coatroom/mirror.yml
current_reflection:
  source: ../abstract/player/CHARACTER.yml
  status: PROTOTYPE (not an instance)
  
  personality_state:
    sims_traits: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]     # All balanced
    mind_mirror: [4, 4, 4, 4, ...]   # All midpoint
    
  mirror_commentary: |
    "You are perfectly balanced. Perfectly undefined. Perfectly... blank.
    Is this who you want to be? Or shall we sculpt something more specific?"
```

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🤔 Interlude: The Prototype Question — "Am I THE player or an INSTANCE OF the player?"</strong></summary>

## Interlude: The Prototype Question

> **PLAYER:** `Am I THE abstract player or am I an INSTANCE OF the abstract player?`

*A profound question about identity.*

The answer: **You ARE the prototype.** The player was playing directly as the template file [`abstract/player/CHARACTER.yml`](../../abstract/player/) — like using a class definition as an object in object-oriented programming. Valid, but unusual.

<details>
<summary>📂 <strong>Prototype vs Instance: MOOLLM uses Self-language style inheritance where characters are cloned from templates</strong></summary>

```yaml
# The MOOLLM character inheritance model
# Inspired by Dave Ungar's Self language

prototype_inheritance:
  concept: |
    Characters follow PROTOTYPE INHERITANCE, not class-based OO:
    
    PROTOTYPE (abstract/player/)
      - The template from which new heroes are cloned
      - Generic traits, placeholder backstory
      - CAN be played directly (but not recommended)
      
    INSTANCE (e.g., captain-ashford/, donna-toadstool/)
      - Cloned from prototype, then customized
      - Unique file in characters/ directory
      - Has specific name, backstory, personality
      
  options_presented:
    a: "Continue editing the template directly"
    b: "Clone yourself into a unique instance"
```

</details>

The player chose to become an INSTANCE. A specific character. A named being.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>🎭 Turn 3: THE FIRST TRANSFORMATION — Becoming a drag king impersonator</strong></summary>

## Turn 3: THE FIRST TRANSFORMATION

> **PLAYER:** `please clone me into an instance, a drag king impersonator of Donald Trump, that is a woman acting as a man. A very bad man. Come up with a name and description and everything else. WICKED!`

The mirror BLAZED. Maurice golf-clapped.

**The initial character: DONNA J. TREMENDOUS**

<details>
<summary>📂 <strong>File creation: New character donna-j-tremendous.yml with ELVIS-IMPERSONATOR-MODEL ethics frame for real-person satire</strong></summary>

```yaml
file_operation:
  type: CREATE
  path: ../donna-j-tremendous.yml
  
  key_elements:
    player:
      name: "Donna J. Tremendous"
      type: player_character
      
    performer:  # The real person behind the drag
      real_name: "Donna Johanssen"
      pronouns: she/her
      profession: "Drag King, Performance Artist"
      
    ethics:
      frame: ELVIS-IMPERSONATOR-MODEL
      # Critical for real-person satire — explicit declaration
      # that this is parody, not imitation
      
    sims_traits:
      outgoing: 10
      nice: 0
      # ... initial amplified traits

# Updated ADVENTURE.yml to point to new character
adventure_update:
  player.character: characters/donna-j-tremendous.yml
```

The **ELVIS-IMPERSONATOR-MODEL** declares "I am an impersonator" by the very name of the role. No deception. The audience knows. Protected satirical tradition from Aristophanes to SNL.

</details>

But the player wanted MORE...

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔥 The Workshop: Amplifying the Awfulness — Jiminy Glick + Divine + Mushroom</strong></summary>

## The Workshop: Amplifying the Awfulness

> **PLAYER:** `Let's workshop the name and character. I want a lot of Jiminy Glick sassiness, Martin Short's character. And the proud brash narcissism of Divine. Kill all people!!! BE MEAN!`

The mirror CRACKED with delight. Maurice started sweating nervously.

**The Unholy Trinity of Inheritance emerged:**

1. **Jiminy Glick (Martin Short)** — False sycophancy, constant interrupting, making everything about self, insults disguised as compliments, sweaty desperation

2. **Divine (John Waters)** — FILTHIEST PERSON ALIVE energy, "KILL EVERYONE NOW!" gleeful villainy, camp as violence, proud excess, villain as hero

3. **The Original Source Material** — Narcissism, superlatives, nicknames as weapons, grievance as identity

4. **Stormy Daniels' Description** — The mushroom. The truth. The eternal humiliation.

<details>
<summary>📂 <strong>The hybrid voice that emerged from combining all four parents</strong></summary>

```yaml
the_hybrid_voice:
  sample: |
    "Oh SWEETIE, you're doing SO WELL! For someone with your... limitations. 
    Did I tell you about MY tremendous— speaking of which, they should all be 
    KILLED, frankly, but in a FABULOUS way, with STYLE, you understand, not 
    like those LOW ENERGY executions, but something SPECTACULAR, anyway, 
    enough about them, let's talk about ME—"
    
  traits_combined:
    from_jiminy: "Oh you're so WONDERFUL for someone so—"
    from_divine: "KILL THEM! ...fabulously"
    from_source: "Many people are saying—" "Very unfair."
    from_stormy: The mushroom is my CROWN now.
```

<details>
<summary><strong>📝 The Name Brainstorm — DON-puns, orange references, scandalous obscenities</strong></summary>

> **PLAYER:** `scandalous obscene references, especially ones he calls other people.`

<details>
<summary>📂 <strong>Name categories considered: DON-puns, orange references, Access Hollywood, Stormy collection, felony collection</strong></summary>

**DON-Based Puns:**

</details>

### 🍄 The Winning Reference

Stormy Daniels described a certain anatomy as resembling *"the mushroom character from Mario Kart"* (Toad).

This became **DONNA TOADSTOOL**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🍄 THE FINAL DECISION: DONNA TOADSTOOL — The Mushroom Queen is born!</strong></summary>

## THE FINAL DECISION: DONNA TOADSTOOL

> **PLAYER:** `DONNA TOADSTOOL is PERFECT!`

The mirror ERUPTED with mushroom-shaped confetti. Maurice regained consciousness just to faint again. Divine's ghost gave a thumbs up from the beyond.

<summary><strong>🔥 Maurice's Complete Reading & Roast — Mind Mirror stats + DEVASTATION</strong></summary>

## Maurice's Complete Reading & Roast

> **PLAYER:** `Ask Maurice to deeply describe me, narrating all my mind mirror and sims stats, and then ROAST ME!!!!!`

[Maurice the Mannequin](../../../coatroom/mannequin.yml) produced a clipboard and delivered the most comprehensive character reading ever performed — followed by DEVASTATION.

### The Reading

Maurice circled slowly, reading each dimension aloud:

> *"NEAT: One. ONE. I've seen cleaner DUMPSTERS."*
>
> *"OUTGOING: Off the scale. You would introduce yourself to a WALL."*
>
> *"NICE: NEGATIVE FIVE. You are a niceness VAMPIRE. You absorb niceness from rooms."*
>
> *"DOCILE: Does. Not. Compute. I tried to measure it and my instruments CAUGHT FIRE."*

### The Roast

Maurice produced an invisible microphone:

> *"The suit is too long. The tie is too red. The tan is... did you fall into a vat of Cheeto dust and just COMMIT?"*

> *"Six bankruptcies. SIX. You failed at CASINOS. People GIVE you money and LOSE. You STILL went bankrupt."*

> *"'Nobody knows more about mushrooms than me.' Oh sweetie. Stormy told us EXACTLY how much you know about mushrooms. It's shaped like TOAD. From MARIO KART."*

The pivot to vulnerable truth:

> *"There's a line in your file — before you DELETED it — that said: 'Actually just wants to be loved but has no idea how to ask for it.' You replaced it with 'KILL THEM.' That's not TREMENDOUS, honey. That's TRAGIC."*

<details>
<summary>📂 <strong>Maurice generated additional backstory: Secret relationships, hidden scandals, Diet Coke monopoly</strong></summary>

```yaml
# Maurice's improvisations for the roast

generated_scandals:
  - The Grue Incident (befriending a grue with Diet Coke)
  - The Diet Coke Monopoly (hoarding across dungeons)
  - The Mushroom Pin Theft (kidnapped actual Toad from Mario Kart)
  - Bankruptcy Number 7 (Trump Grue Resort — eaten)

generated_relationships:
  ex_wife_1: "Ivana the Barbarian" — settlement: Maze rooms A-J
  ex_wife_2: "Marla the Mage" — settlement: copyright on 'Tremendous'
  ex_wife_3: "Melania the Statue" — "I REALLY don't care. Do U?"
  son_eric: "Nobody remembers"
  secret_nemesis: "Sleepy Steve" (the grue) — they play chess Wednesdays
```

</details>

Maurice then collapsed onto an invisible fainting couch. The roast was complete.

<summary><strong>📁 File Reorganization: Moving to Fictional — Both performer and persona are fictional</strong></summary>

## File Reorganization: Moving to Fictional

> **PLAYER:** `let's delete the old donna-j-tremendous dir and move donna-toadstool to fictional! Both her real identity and drag identity are fictional.`

The character needed proper categorization. Both the performer (Donna Johanssen) AND the drag persona (Donna Toadstool) are entirely fictional.

<details>
<summary>📂 <strong>Directory operations: Deleting old dir, moving to fictional/, updating all path references</strong></summary>

```yaml
directory_operations:

  step_1:
    operation: DELETE (rmdir)
    path: ../donna-j-tremendous/

    added:
      meta.fictional_status: |
        BOTH the performer (Donna Johanssen) AND the drag persona 
        (Donna Toadstool) are entirely FICTIONAL characters.
```

Character "location" in the game world (coatroom/) is stored in the character's own CHARACTER.yml. Character FILE location (fictional/donna-toadstool/) is filesystem categorization, not spatial position.

### 2. Characters Own Their Own State

- **GET LAMP** → Update `lamp.yml.state`, update `CHARACTER.yml.player.inventory`
- **GO EAST** → Update `CHARACTER.yml.player.location`
- The character file is canonical. ADVENTURE.yml has convenience mirrors.
- Objects and characters stay in place as files; state changes in YAML.

### 3. Comments Are Semantic Data (YAML-JAZZ)

```yaml
nice: -5  # NEGATIVE NICE. Anti-nice. Weaponized un-nice.
          # The comment explains the NUMBER. The LLM reads BOTH.
```

### 4. Prototype-Based Inheritance

Characters cloned from templates, not instantiated from classes. Inspired by Dave Ungar's Self language.

### 5. Ethics Frames for Real-Person Satire

```yaml
ethics:
  frame: ELVIS-IMPERSONATOR-MODEL
  declaration: "I am a DRAG KING IMPERSONATOR performing satirical parody"
```

**DONNA TOADSTOOL** strikes a pose in the doorway — backlit by the dungeon's darkness, a VISION of orange foundation and gilded pompadour wig.

### Turn 5-10: Commandeering the Pie Table

Donna STRIDES toward the [Pie Table](../../../pub/pie-table.yml) — the octagonal round table where debates happen.

<details>
<summary>📂 <strong>Pie Table seating: Donna takes the North seat, facing Bumblewick at South</strong></summary>

The Pie Table is a physical pie menu — compass directions address each seat!

Donna spots the [Gong of Gezelligheid](../../../pub/gong.yml) and grabs the mallet.

# ***GONNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGG***

Every conversation STOPS. Every eye turns to Donna.

> *"GOOD EVENING, LOSERS AND ALSO SOME WINNERS! I am DONNA TOADSTOOL! The MUSHROOM QUEEN! Tonight, I will be PERFORMING on your tiny stage!"*
