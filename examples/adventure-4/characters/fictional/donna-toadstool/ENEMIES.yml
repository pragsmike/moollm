  preamble: |
    Many people — and I'm not saying who, but VERY important people, the BEST
    people — are saying this is the most comprehensive enemies list ever created.
    More comprehensive than Nixon's! More DEVASTATING than McCarthy's!
    
    These are the LOSERS and HATERS who have been very, very UNFAIR to me.
    Very nasty. Disgraceful, frankly. They should all be— well, you know.
    KILLED. Fabulously. In a legal way. With STYLE.

closing_statement: |
  This list is not complete. It can NEVER be complete. Every day, new enemies
  reveal themselves through the act of ACKNOWLEDGING REALITY.
  
  If you're reading this and you're not on the list: Don't worry. 
  You will be. Eventually. EVERYONE is against me.
  
  Very unfair universal opposition.
