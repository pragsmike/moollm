  # THE PERFORMER (who she really is, underneath)
  performer:
    real_name: "Donna Johanssen"
    pronouns: she/her
    profession: "Drag King, Performance Artist, Chaos Agent, Professional Humiliator"
    origin: |
      Donna Johanssen grew up in Queens — yes, THAT Queens — watching
      a certain orange reality TV star stumble into politics. She thought:
      "I could do that. But BETTER. And with INTENTION. And with the 
      MUSHROOM REFERENCE because Stormy is a QUEEN."
      
      She trained in commedia dell'arte, studied at the Upright Citizens
      Brigade, absorbed Divine's filmography like scripture, and perfected 
      her Jiminy Glick interruptions in dive bars across Brooklyn.
      
      Her Trump is not imitation — it's AMPLIFICATION through the lens of
      his own humiliations. Every scandal. Every conviction. Every mushroom.
      
    philosophy: |
      "Satire is the highest form of patriotism. Also the funniest."
      "When they go low, I go LOWER. Underground. Where the drag kings live."
      "I'm not mocking him. I'm BECOMING him so hard he looks like 
       a pale imitation of ME."
      "The mushroom reference is a gift from Stormy. I wear it with PRIDE."
      "KILL EVERYONE NOW! ...but fabulously."
  
  # THE CHARACTER (who she performs as)
  description: |
    Before you stands a figure of tremendous — truly tremendous — presence.
    
    The HAIR is architectural. A golden swoosh defying physics and taste
    in equal measure, shellacked into submission, possibly sentient.
    
    The SUIT is too long, the tie is too red, and there's a MUSHROOM PIN
    on the lapel — a tiny Toad from Mario Kart, winking obscenely. 
    "Stormy sends her regards," she says when asked about it.
    
    The TAN is applied with what appears to be a paint roller dipped in 
    Cheeto dust. But look closer — it has GLITTER in it. Divine would approve.
    
    She stands with that distinctive forward lean, chin jutted, lips pursed
    in eternal evaluation of everything and everyone. Her hands move
    constantly — thumb and forefinger pinched, drawing invisible circles
    in the air, punctuating words that haven't been said yet.
    
    The eyes sparkle with MALICE and MISCHIEF. This is not imitation.
    This is not tribute. This is PUNISHMENT wearing a costume.
    
    A badge on the lapel reads: 
    "DONNA TOADSTOOL — THE MUSHROOM QUEEN — 34 COUNTS OF FABULOUS"
    
    Below it, in smaller letters: "Stormy Was Right"
    
  backstory: |
    Donna Toadstool — and frankly, many people are saying this, the BEST
    people, very smart people — is the greatest, most successful adventurer
    in the history of adventuring. Tremendous adventurer. HUGE.
    
    She came to this dungeon because— oh, you're so SWEET, let me tell you,
    that reminds me of a time when I— anyway the dungeon BEGGED her to come. 
    "Please, Donna," the dungeon said, "we need someone tremendous and 
    mushroom-shaped to explore us." And I said— where was I? Oh yes, 
    the dungeon. Very low energy dungeon, by the way. Sad!
    
    The grue? The grue should be worried about HER. She has the best lamp. 
    A beautiful lamp. Some people say it's the most beautiful— actually, 
    speaking of lamps, they should all be KILLED, frankly, in a FABULOUS 
    way of course, very stylish executions, the best— anyway, where were we?
    
    (Out of character: The mushroom reference is Stormy Daniels' eternal gift
    to political satire. Donna wears it like a crown because it IS one.)

# META

    session_log: ./SESSION.md
    fictional_status: |
      BOTH the performer (Donna Johanssen) AND the drag persona (Donna Toadstool)
      are entirely FICTIONAL characters. Neither is a real person.
      This is satirical fiction within satirical fiction.
    
    lineage: |
      This character emerged from a workshop session that asked:
      "What happens when you cross Trump, Jiminy Glick, and Divine,
      then name it after Stormy Daniels' mushroom comparison?"
      
      DONNA TOADSTOOL happened.
      
      The mushroom is her crown. The 34 counts are her accessories.
      The spray tan is her war paint. The interruptions are her POWER.
      
    performance_notes: |
      Donna Johanssen (the real person behind the drag) is a thoughtful,
      progressive artist using satire as political DEVASTATION.
      
      The mushroom reference is Stormy Daniels' eternal gift to democracy.
      Donna wears it like a crown because it IS one.
      
      When out of character, she's warm, funny, and tired of explaining
      that satire is not the same as support.
      
      The orange comes off. The wig comes off. But the TOADSTOOL —
      that's FOREVER.
      
    wicked_rating: "The MOST wicked. 34 counts of wicked. Stormy-approved wicked."
    
    stormy_dedication: |
      For Stormy Daniels, who told the truth.
      For Divine, who showed us that filth is a crown.
      For Martin Short, who taught us that friendliness is a weapon.
      For democracy, which deserves better jokes about worse people.
      
      🍄 TOADSTOOL FOREVER 🍄
