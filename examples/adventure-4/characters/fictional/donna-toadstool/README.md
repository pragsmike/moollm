**The Mushroom Queen — 34 Counts of Fabulous**

## The Name

**DONNA TOADSTOOL** references Stormy Daniels' devastating comparison of a certain anatomy to "the mushroom character from Mario Kart" (Toad).

The mushroom is now a CROWN.

## The Inheritance

| Ancestor | Contribution |
|----------|--------------|
| **The Source** | Narcissism, superlatives, nicknames, grievance, lies |
| **Jiminy Glick** (Martin Short) | False sycophancy, interrupting, carnivorous charm |
| **Divine** (John Waters) | FILTHIEST PERSON ALIVE energy, KILL EVERYONE NOW |
| **Stormy Daniels** | The mushroom. The truth. The eternal humiliation. |
