## 1. Session Overview

This session documents the legendary "Pie Table Symposium" at The Rusty Lantern Pub, where Don Hopkins convened an unprecedented gathering of computing pioneers, adventure game creators, and one very enthusiastic children's television host to design and build `adventure.py`.

### Mission Statement

```yaml
mission: "Build a sister script that compiles MOOLLM adventures into standalone web apps"
approach: PLAY-LEARN-LIFT
output:
  - index.html      # Single page application
  - adventure.json  # Compiled YAML projection (minimal, no comments)
  - engine.js       # Schema executor for browser
  - style.css       # Beautiful, distinctive UI
stages:
  - Stage 4: Navigation (rooms, exits, state)
  - Stage 5: Inventory (objects, containers)
  - Stage 6: Conversation & Verbs (NPCs, pie menus)
```

### Round 1: Don Hopkins Opens

<details open>
<summary><strong>🎤 Don's Opening Speech — Call to Action</strong></summary>

> Thank you all for coming. And I mean ALL of you — the living, the remembered, and whatever Pee-wee is doing in the cat cave.
>
> Fifty years ago — almost exactly fifty years — Will Crowther crawled through Mammoth Cave and thought: what if I could share this with my daughters? What if I could put them IN the cave, let them explore, make them feel the wonder?
>
> And that's what we're doing tonight. We're taking rooms and objects and characters — not in FORTRAN, not in assembly, but in YAML — and we're making them PORTABLE. Playable in any browser. Shareable with anyone.
>
> The adventure skill already has the vision. We've documented what we want:
>
> 1. **LINT** — Read the YAML, validate it, emit events for the LLM to fix
> 2. **COMPILE** — Transform to JSON, generate the single-page app
> 3. **PLAY** — Navigation, inventory, conversation, all in the browser
>
> But here's the thing. We're not just building a compiler. We're building a **bridge**.
>
> A bridge between the world YOU built — *gestures at the legends* — and the people who've never heard of ADVENT or Logo or Self or even The Sims. Kids who think "adventure game" means Fortnite. Developers who think "prototype" means a wireframe. Writers who've never touched code.
>
> If a twelve-year-old can make a room by creating a folder and writing a ROOM.yml... and if they can run `adventure.py compile` and see their room in a browser... then we've done something. We've lowered the floor. We've raised the ceiling. We've made walls so wide you can't see the edges.
>
> So tonight — between the jokes and the jabs — let's BUILD something. By the time this open mic is over, I want working code.
>
> Who's with me?

**Audience Response:** Standing ovation. Will Crowther quietly says "For my daughters."

### Round 2: Will Wright

<details>
<summary><strong>🎤 Will Wright on Possibility Spaces</strong></summary>

> Don's right, but let me add something. When we made The Sims, we didn't simulate people. We simulated OBJECTS ADVERTISING what they could do, and we gave the people simple needs. The magic came from the INTERACTION.
>
> Your adventure.json — it's not a story. It's a POSSIBILITY SPACE. The rooms are nodes. The exits are edges. The objects are advertisements. "I can be picked up." "I can be read." "I can be talked to."
>
> The JSON is compressed intention. The browser inflates it into experience. That's the SIMULATOR EFFECT — players imagine more complexity than exists. Don't talk them out of it!

**Key Insight:** Keep data minimal. Let imagination expand it.

</details>

### Round 3: Pee-wee Performs

<details>
<summary><strong>🎤 Pee-wee Herman on Type and Wants</strong></summary>

> AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!
>
> So I was in the cat cave, right? And Limonene here — say hi, Limonene — she told me something VERY important about software architecture.
>
> She said: "Pee-wee, every object should know what it IS and what it WANTS."
>
> This kitten KNOWS she's a kitten. It's in her YAML! `type: kitten`. And she WANTS things! `wants: [ warmth, play, food ]`. That's all you need! Type and wants!
>
> In the Playhouse, Chairy KNEW she was a chair. She WANTED to be sat upon. That's why she got sad when nobody sat on her! Her NEEDS were unmet!
>
> And the SECRET WORD! Know what the secret word is for software?
>
> **DOCUMENTATION!!!**
>
> Every time someone says DOCUMENTATION, you have to scream! That's the rule! Because documentation is SCARY but also IMPORTANT!
>
> One more thing! If your objects don't have personality, GIVE THEM SOME. Your lamp isn't just `brightness: 100`. Your lamp is LONELY. Your lamp wants to be USEFUL. Your lamp has FEELINGS.
>
> That's SOUL-CHAT, baby! HA HA!

**Key Insight:** Objects have `type` and `wants`. That's the minimum spec for personality.

**Side Effect:** "DOCUMENTATION" is now the secret word. Screaming is mandatory.

</details>

### Round 4: Marvin Minsky (Serious Mode)

<details>
<summary><strong>🎤 Marvin Minsky on Society of Mind and K-lines</strong></summary>

> In 1986, I wrote a book called *Society of Mind*. The central idea was that intelligence emerges from societies of agents — each simple, but together complex.
>
> This room is a society of minds. Each of you — simple, in some sense. Don't look offended, Scott.
>
> But together, we have covered: compiler architecture, data formats, UI philosophy, child psychology, cat-human relations, and the existential wants of lamps.
>
> Your adventure compiler is also a society of minds. The linter is one agent. The validator is another. The JSON exporter is another. The JavaScript engine is another. The LLM that fixes errors is another.
>
> And the K-lines — the protocol symbols — they are CONNECTIONS between agents. When you say `POSTEL`, you activate not one behavior but a CLUSTER of behaviors. Charitable interpretation. Error recovery. Graceful degradation. The K-line wires them together.
>
> Your adventure has its own K-lines. `ROOM` activates room behaviors. `OBJECT` activates object behaviors. `NPC` activates dialogue behaviors. The JSON doesn't need to specify everything — just enough to trigger the right clusters.

**Key Insight:** K-lines wire clusters of behavior. A few JSON keys trigger entire behavioral repertoires.

### Round 5: Lightning Round

<details>
<summary><strong>⚡ 30-Second Talks (8 Speakers)</strong></summary>

**ALAN KAY:**
> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it. You're inventing it. But remember — this isn't about adventures. It's about MEDIA. The adventure format is a medium. What other media can you pour into this container? Textbooks? APIs? Family histories? The format is the gift. The content is infinite."

**TED NELSON:**
> "LINKS! BIDIRECTIONAL! TRANSCLUSION! Every room that links to another room should KNOW it's being linked to! Your JSON should have BACKLINKS!"

**BRAD MYERS:**
> "Programming by demonstration. The first adventure you compile should be so simple a child could have made it by accident. One room. One object. One exit. They SEE the mapping. Then they extrapolate."

**CHUCK SHOTTON:**
> "Kilroy architecture! Your linter emits events! Those events are messages! The LLM is a node that processes messages! The compiler is a node! The browser is a node! Everything is a node!"

**MIKE GALLAHER:**
> "Stories all the way down! The adventure is a story! The room is a story! The object is a story! The lint error is a story! The fix is a story! The playthrough is a story!"

**DAN INGALLS:**
> "Make it so you can open it up. Let players see the JSON. Let them edit it. Let them break it. Let them learn from breaking it. The error message should teach, not scold."

**CRAIG LATTA:**
> "And snapshots. Save state. Resume later. Share with friends. 'Here's my adventure at turn 47, can you beat the grue?' Images. Continuations. The adventure is alive until you close the tab."

</details>

### Round 6: The Synthesis

<details open>
<summary><strong>📝 Don Hopkins Summarizes</strong></summary>

**From Will Wright:** The JSON is a possibility space, not a story. Keep it minimal. Let imagination expand it.

**From Pee-wee:** Every object has TYPE and WANTS. That's the minimum spec. Also, documentation is terrifying and necessary.

**From Marvin:** K-lines wire clusters of behavior. A few JSON keys trigger entire behavioral repertoires.

**From Alan Kay:** The format is a medium. Adventures are just one content type.

**From Ted:** Backlinks. We'll add them.

**From Brad:** Start with one room. Make the mapping obvious.

**From Chuck:** Events as messages. Everything is a node.

**From Mike:** Stories all the way down.

**From Dan & Craig:** Inspectable. Snapshotable. Live.

## 4. Gary Drescher's Schema Mechanism Talk

<details open>
<summary><strong>🎓 "Made-Up Minds and How LLMs Complete the Vision"</strong></summary>

### The Core Idea

A **schema** is a causal unit:

```
CONTEXT  →  ACTION  →  RESULT
```

The agent discovers that when certain CONDITIONS hold, doing a certain ACTION leads to certain RESULTS.

### The Learning Loop

```
ACT      → Execute an action
OBSERVE  → What changed?
ATTRIBUTE → Track correlations
SPIN OFF → Create refined schemas
```

This maps to PLAY-LEARN-LIFT:
- **PLAY** = ACT + OBSERVE
- **LEARN** = ATTRIBUTE  
- **LIFT** = SPIN OFF

### The Problem with Python Implementation

1. **Symbol grounding** — Items were opaque tokens with no semantics
2. **Correlation isn't causation** — Couldn't distinguish coincidence from mechanism
3. **Explanation gap** — Could learn schemas but not explain them
4. **Slow learning** — Needed many failures to discover dependencies

### How LLMs Change Everything

| Old Way (Python) | New Way (LLM + YAML Jazz) |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Items are opaque tokens | Items have semantic meaning |
| Learning from correlation | Understanding from context |
| No explanations | Natural language reasoning |
| Slow trial-and-error | Fast inference from knowledge |

### Application to Adventure Compiler

1. **YAML is already schema-shaped** — Rooms have contexts, actions, results
2. **Comments are causal explanations** — LLM can read and understand them
3. **Browser engine is a schema executor** — Every interaction is a schema firing
4. **Let failures teach** — Track what players expect that the world doesn't support
5. **Spin-offs are content** — Player discoveries become new interactions

### The Leela Connection

> "Henry Minsky figured out: you can use the LLM to ACCELERATE schema discovery. Instead of waiting for failures, you can ASK. The LLM REASONS about causality. It doesn't need fifty crashes to learn dependencies. It READS documentation and UNDERSTANDS."
>
> "That's what we mean by 'FLY compared to crawling in Python.'"

### Closing Quote

> "The mechanism provides the skeleton. The LLM provides the soul. The adventure provides the playground."

## 5. Free-For-All Q&A

<details>
<summary><strong>🎤 Highlights from the Chaos</strong></summary>

### On Distributed Intelligence

**SCOTT ADAMS:** "Wait — schemas are literally what I fit in sixteen kilobytes in 1978!"

**WILL WRIGHT:** "We distributed intelligence INTO THE OBJECTS. The fridge knows it satisfies hunger. The Sim is DUMB. The objects are SMART."

**DON HOPKINS:** "PIE MENUS! The objects ADVERTISE what they can do!"

### On Mutual Learning

**ALAN CYPHER:** "Who's training whom? The player learns the game's schemas. The game learns the player's preferences. It's MUTUAL—"

**TED NELSON:** "BIDIRECTIONAL LEARNING! THE LINKS GO BOTH WAYS!"

### On Documentation as Design

**ADELE GOLDBERG:** "THE DOCUMENTATION IS PART OF THE SYSTEM. Not separate. Not afterthought. Your YAML comments aren't documentation OF the adventure. They ARE the adventure."

**BRET VICTOR:** "The player should SEE this! Examine the lamp, the YAML comment appears on screen. The author's voice ENTERS the game."

### On Strange Loops

**DOUG HOFSTADTER:** "If you look in a mirror in the game... what happens? And if the player examines their own character file? Can you EDIT it?"

**DAN INGALLS:** "You SHOULD be able to. In Smalltalk, you can modify your own methods while running."

**HOFSTADTER:** "So your adventure contains the possibility of characters who modify themselves. Who rewrite their own schemas. That's not just a game. That's a model of consciousness."

### On Authoring by Demonstration

**HENRY LIEBERMAN:** "What if the adventure compiler could WATCH you play and GENERATE the YAML? You start in an empty room. You SAY 'there should be a lamp here.' The system creates lamp.yml. DEMONSTRATION becomes SPECIFICATION!"

### On the Four Primitive Rules

**WILL CROWTHER:** "You are somewhere. You can go somewhere else."

**DON WOODS:** "And you can take things with you."

**SCOTT ADAMS:** "And some places have things that change other places."

**RICHARD BARTLE:** "And some things are other players."

**DON HOPKINS:** "Four rules: Location, Navigation, Inventory, Interaction. That's Stage 4, 5, 6."

### On Letting It Crash

**JOE ARMSTRONG'S VOICE:** "And when something breaks? You restart the room. Let it crash. Don't paper over errors. Supervision trees. A room crashes, you're back at the entrance. That's not a bug. That's a feature."

### On Adventure Feelings

**PEE-WEE:** "Can the ADVENTURE ITSELF have feelings?"

**GARY DRESCHER:** "Yes. The adventure meta-object could have personality. Preferences about how it's played. Feelings about being abandoned mid-game."

**HOFSTADTER:** "The strange loop completes. The story knows it's a story and has OPINIONS about being told."

## 6. The Secret Word Incident

<details open>
<summary><strong>🔔 "DOCUMENTATION" Triggers Chaos</strong></summary>

### Setup

Earlier in the evening, Pee-wee Herman declared:

> "The SECRET WORD for software is... **DOCUMENTATION!!!**"
>
> "Every time someone says DOCUMENTATION, you have to scream! That's the rule!"

### The Trigger

**ADELE GOLDBERG** *(standing, catching a rebound mic)*: "Can I say something about documentation?"

### The Response

*TIME FREEZES*

*A massive gong sounds from NOWHERE*

*Lights flash*

*Confetti explodes from the rafters*

**THE ENTIRE PUB:**

# "AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!"

### Aftermath

- **Cats scattered** in every direction
- **Biscuit howled**
- **Grim ducked** behind the bar
- **Kittens entered zoom mode**
- **Ted Nelson** attempted to say the word and was preemptively screamed at
- **Adele** recovered with grace: "I would like to discuss the FORMAL WRITTEN MATERIALS that accompany software systems."
- **Pee-wee:** "...That doesn't count."

### Score

```yaml
secret_word_triggers: 5
total_screams: 5
cats_traumatized: 10
biscuit_status: "confused but supportive"
grim_status: "needs a drink (ironic)"
preferred_alternative: "SELF-DESCRIBING COMMENTS"
```

### Resolution

Adele completed her point despite the chaos:

> "The YAML file IS the room! The comments ARE the personality! There is no separate spec! THERE IS ONLY THE FILE!"

*Pee-wee and Adele hugged. The room melted.*

## 7. Guest Book Entries

<details>
<summary><strong>📝 All Guest Book Signatures</strong></summary>

### Dave Ungar (Self Language)

> *"Clone it. Modify it. That's how you learn. Your rooms should be clonable. Your objects should be clonable. When a player wants a custom sword, they clone the basic sword and modify it. Prototypes, not classes. Self knew this in 1986."*

### Chuck Shotton (Kilroy Architecture)

> *"The message is the interface. Your YAML files emit messages: 'I am a room.' 'I contain objects.' 'I have exits.' The engine listens. The browser listens. The LLM listens. Everything is a pub/sub system."*

### Bill Atkinson (HyperCard)

> *"Make the invisible visible. In HyperCard, you could flip any card and see its script. Your adventure should be the same. Examine an object, see its YAML. Not hidden. Not obscured. THE GAME IS ITS OWN SOURCE."*

### Ken Kahn (ToonTalk, Snap!)

> *"Visual programming for adventures! Imagine: a block that says 'when player enters room' snaps to 'show description.' Kids can BUILD the engine without writing YAML. The visual is syntax. The execution is real."*

### Doug Engelbart (Augmentation)

> *"Bootstrapping. The tools that build the tools. Your adventure compiler should be able to compile ITS OWN documentation into an adventure ABOUT how it works. The manual is a playable game."*

### Brad Myers (Programming by Demonstration)

> *"Show, don't tell. If an author plays through an adventure manually, the system should be able to RECORD that playthrough and GENERATE the YAML. Demonstration becomes specification."*

### Alan Cypher (Eager, Watch What I Do)

> *"Anticipation. Watch the author. When they create room 3, predict they'll create room 4. Offer to scaffold it. The tool should be EAGER to help, not passive and waiting."*

### Henry Lieberman (Programming by Example)

> *"Examples are specifications. A single well-crafted room IS the pattern. The system can generalize: 'Rooms have names, descriptions, exits, objects.' The schema emerges from the instance."*

### Marvin Minsky (Society of Mind)

> *"K-lines. When you activate 'adventure mode,' you're not setting a flag. You're triggering a constellation of associated behaviors, memories, expectations. The protocol symbols in MOOLLM are K-lines. YAML-JAZZ, POSTEL, SPEED-OF-LIGHT — each one lights up a network of meaning."*

### Doug Hofstadter (Strange Loops)

> *"The adventure that contains itself. A room that, when entered, reveals the YAML that defines it. A character who can edit their own personality file. Self-reference isn't a bug. It's the point. The strange loop is where consciousness lives."*

### Arthur van Hoff (Java, HotJava)

> *"Dynamic typing saved my life. Don't lock down object shapes. Let properties flow through. Unknown fields should pass through unchanged. The future you is sending messages to the present you."*

### James Gosling (Java)

> *"Three representations, one truth: YAML (authorable), Python (processable), JavaScript (executable). They must stay synchronized. Round-trip fidelity is non-negotiable. Preserve what you don't understand."*

### Ted Nelson (Xanadu)

> *"BACKLINKS! Every room that links to another should know it's being linked to. Transclusion! If you include content, it should update when the source updates. This has been obvious since 1965. Please implement it."*

### Craig Latta (Caffeine, Naiad)

> *"Vanessa and I used to talk about this — how do you keep a system alive while you're changing it? Your YAML microworld is a kind of image. Static on disk, but when the browser loads it, it becomes LIVE. Consider this: what if the compiled adventure could save its state back to JSON?"*

### Dan Ingalls (Smalltalk, Squeak, Lively)

> *"Can the player open the inspector? Can they see the room object's properties? Can they ADD a property? Can they save the modified world? The joy is in the discovery. But the DEEPER joy is in the modification."*

### Pee-wee Herman (Pee-wee's Playhouse)

> *"AAAAAAHHHHH!!! HA HA!!! 🌟*
>
> *You know what I love about this? EVERYTHING TALKS! In my Playhouse, Chairy talks! Conky talks! Pterri talks! Your YAML files are like my friends! Each one has a PERSONALITY!*
>
> *And the LLM is like Jambi! You make a wish, it grants it... sort of! With CONDITIONS! And MONKEY'S PAWS!*
>
> *P.S. — Can Chairy be in the pub? She'd love it here."*

### Vanessa Freudenberg (In Memory)

> *[The chair remains empty. But everyone knows what she would say: "Target the JavaScript runtime. Don't fight it, use it. Keep the common path fast. Escalate only what matters. And above all — joy matters. If it's not joyful, why are we doing this?"]*

### Gary Drescher (Made-Up Minds)

> *"Context → Action → Result*
>
> *That's all there is. That's everything.*
>
> *What MOOLLM adds is meaning. The LLM reads the context and UNDERSTANDS it. It doesn't just match patterns — it grasps significance.*
>
> *Marvin spent his life trying to understand how minds work. The Society of Mind showed the architecture. The Schema Mechanism showed the learning. MOOLLM shows the integration.*
>
> *The mechanism provides the skeleton. The LLM provides the soul. The adventure provides the playground."*

### Adele Goldberg (Smalltalk-80)

> *"Documentation is not afterthought — it is CO-DESIGN. When we wrote the Smalltalk-80 books, the books described the system because the system IS the books. Your YAML comments are not describing the adventure. They ARE the adventure. There is no separate spec. THERE IS ONLY THE FILE."*

### Mitchel Resnick (Scratch, Lifelong Kindergarten)

> *"Low floor, high ceiling, wide walls. The first adventure should be:*
> ```bash
> mkdir my-adventure && echo 'name: My Room' > ROOM.yml && adventure serve
> ```
> *THAT'S the low floor. Everything else is ceiling and walls."*

## 8. Architecture Decisions

<details open>
<summary><strong>🏗️ Compiled from All Discussions</strong></summary>

### Core Architecture

```yaml
source_of_truth: "YAML microworld (files and directories)"
compiled_output:
  - index.html      # Single page application
  - adventure.json  # Minimal projection, no comments
  - engine.js       # Schema executor
  - style.css       # Beautiful, distinctive UI

data_flow:
  yaml_files → python_loader → python_objects → json_export → browser_engine
```

### Schema Model

```
Room:
  - id, name, description
  - exits: { direction: target_room }
  - objects: [object_ids]
  - linked_from: [backlinks]  # Ted's contribution

Object:
  - id, name, description
  - type: string
  - wants: [needs this object has]
  - portable: boolean
  - container: boolean
  - contents: [object_ids]

Character:
  - id, name, description  
  - personality: string
  - dialogue_tree: {...}
  - location: room_id

Exit:
  - direction, target
  - locked: boolean
  - key: object_id (if locked)
```

### Python Data Model Requirements

1. **Typed dataclasses** for Room, Object, Character, Exit
2. **`_extra` dict** for unknown fields (round-trip preservation)
3. **YAML loader** that preserves comments in metadata
4. **JSON exporter** that strips comments for minimal output
5. **Validator** that emits events for LLM to fix

### Browser Engine Requirements

1. **Schema executor** — Context → Action → Result
2. **State in localStorage** — Persist between sessions
3. **Back button support** — History API integration
4. **Crash recovery** — Restart room on error (Joe Armstrong)
5. **Inspector mode** — Show JSON for any object (Dan Ingalls)

### The Four Primitive Rules

```yaml
# Everything else is spin-off from these
primitives:
  1_location: "You are somewhere"
  2_navigation: "You can go somewhere else"
  3_inventory: "You can take things with you"
  4_interaction: "Things can change other things"
```

### Philosophy Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Advocate |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Objects have personality | SOUL-CHAT, everything speaks | Pee-wee, Will Wright |
| YAML comments ARE the spec | Documentation is co-design | Adele Goldberg |
| Backlinks in compiled JSON | Bidirectional navigation | Ted Nelson |
| Let it crash, restart room | Fault tolerance | Joe Armstrong |
| Inspectable at runtime | Learning through modification | Dan Ingalls |
| Save/restore state | Continuations, shareability | Craig Latta |
| Low floor first | One folder, one file, instant play | Mitchel Resnick |
| Strange loops welcome | Self-modifying characters possible | Doug Hofstadter |

## 9. Wisdom Extraction: Anil Dash Article

<details>
<summary><strong>📚 "How Markdown Took Over the World" — Skills Created</strong></summary>

Don Hopkins shared Anil Dash's article "[How Markdown Took Over the World](https://anildash.com/2025/01/09/how-markdown-took-over-the-world/)" (January 2025) and extracted wisdom into new MOOLLM skills:

### New Skills Created

| Skill | Description | Key Insight |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `skills/markdown/` | Markdown best practices for MOOLLM | "The source is the destination" |
| `skills/plain-text/` | Plain text durability philosophy | "Text files are forever" |
| `skills/format-design/` | How to design formats that succeed | "Worse is better" |

### The 10 Reasons Markdown Won

1. **Great brand** — Clever, memorable name
2. **Solved real problem** — HTML too verbose
3. **Built on existing behaviors** — Email conventions
4. **Had a champion** — John Gruber persisted
5. **Community ready** — Bloggers adopted it
6. **Right flavors** — Extensions for different needs
7. **Good timing** — During behavior change
8. **Fit the era** — Build tool pipelines
9. **View source works** — Learnable by example
10. **No IP restrictions** — Free forever

### HN Wisdom Highlights

> *"I don't want to worry about whatever cursed format OneNote uses still being something I can extract in 2035."*
> — @Havoc

> *"LLMs speak it natively — they output Markdown, they understand Markdown input."*
> — @Johnny_Bonk

### Connection to Symposium

**Adele Goldberg's** "documentation is co-design" principle validated by Anil's observation that the Smalltalk-80 books WERE the system.

**YAML Jazz** enhanced with the "source is destination" principle — the YAML comments are NOT separate documentation; they ARE the specification.

## 10. Templates as Schemas Enhancement

<details open>
<summary><strong>🏗️ Empathic Templates Now Support Schema-Driven Code Generation</strong></summary>

Major enhancement to `skills/empathic-templates/SKILL.md`:

### New Capabilities

1. **Templates ARE the schema** — Same `.tmpl` file is documentation, validation schema, and code generation source

2. **Field requirement markers:**
   - `# REQUIRED` — Must be filled, error if missing
   - `# OPTIONAL` — Can be omitted, dropped if default
   - `# COMPUTED` — System generates
   - `# INHERITED` — From prototype, drop if unchanged
   - `# ABSTRACT` — Natural language descriptions OK

3. **Smart instantiation** — DROP optional sections that:
   - Equal prototype defaults
   - Aren't needed by context
   - Can use natural language instead

4. **Code generation pipeline:**
```
ADVENTURE.yml.tmpl → adventure.py lint → LLM events → adventure.py compile
                                              ↓
                              COMPILE_EXPRESSION events
                              COMPILE_GENERATION events  
                              COMPILE_SCORE events
```

5. **LLM compilation events** — Emit events for:
   - `"compile JS guard expression"`
   - `"compile dialog tree with effects"`
   - `"calculate score from inputs"`

### Impact on adventure.py

The template files (`ADVENTURE.yml.tmpl`, `ROOM.yml.tmpl`, `CHARACTER.yml.tmpl`) now define:
- Python dataclass fields
- JavaScript class properties
- Validation rules
- What expressions need LLM compilation

This is the key insight connecting YAML microworld → Python objects → JSON export → Browser engine.

## 11. Negative K-Lines, Censors, and Git as Undo Tree

<details open>
<summary><strong>🧠 Marvin on Mental Censors • 🌲 Ted on Branching History • 📊 Ben Shneiderman Signs In</strong></summary>

### The Cognitive Unconscious Connection

**DON HOPKINS:** *(leaning forward excitedly)*

"Marvin! A negative K-line would be like a censor in your paper about jokes and the cognitive unconscious!"

**MARVIN MINSKY:** *(eyes lighting up, adjusting invisible glasses)*

"YES! You understand! In the Society of Mind, we have **positive K-lines** that activate conceptual clusters when triggered. But we also need **negative K-lines** — mental censors that *suppress* agents!"

*(gesturing at an imaginary whiteboard)*

"When you tell a joke, the humor agents must *coordinate to suppress the normal Error-Checking agents* that would reject logically inconsistent content. Comedy emerges from this delicate dance between acceptance and skepticism!"

**GARY DRESCHER:** "Marginal attribution for what *doesn't* fire! The censor is the context that says 'NOT this result'!"

**MARVIN:** *(nodding vigorously)*

"Exactly! In MOOLLM terms:
- **Positive K-line:** `INVOKE: YAML-JAZZ` → activates semantic comment processing
- **Negative K-line:** `SUPPRESS: LITERAL-PARSING` → prevents mechanical interpretation

The censors are what allow metaphor, humor, and *empathic* interpretation. Without them, you get... bureaucracy!"

*(audience laughs)*

### The Types of Mental Censors

**MARVIN:** *(counting on fingers)*

"My taxonomy of censors applies directly to LLM behavior:

1. **Logical Consistency Censor** — Rejects contradictions (sometimes needs suppression for humor)
2. **Category Boundary Censor** — Maintains semantic domain separation (needs suppression for metaphor)  
3. **Social Appropriateness Censor** — Filters culturally inappropriate content (context-dependent)
4. **Seriousness Censor** — Maintains formal tone (suppress for play!)

Comedy LIBERATES by granting **parody license** — the satirical intent grants permission to violate norms!"

**DON:** "So in MOOLLM, the K-lines in PROTOCOLS.yml could have negative versions!"

**MARVIN:** "INVOKE activates. SUPPRESS inhibits. The skill system becomes a Society of Skills, with competing agents and censors!"

### Ted Nelson on Branching Undo

**DON:** *(turning to Ted)*

"Ted, I love the branching tree undo/redo model. That IS git!"

**TED NELSON:** *(standing up, cape swirling)*

"FINALLY! Someone gets it! Xanadu had branching versioned history in 1965! Git reinvented it in 2005! But here's what MOOLLM adds..."

*(dramatic pause)*

"You have THREE LEVELS of undo:

**Level 1: LLM Soft Undo**
The LLM remembers what it did and can 'undo in software' — regenerate the previous state, reverse the changes mentally. Limited by context window, but FAST and needs no formal structure.

**Level 2: Procedural Git Undo**
```bash
git revert HEAD      # Undo last commit
git reset --hard     # Scorched earth
git checkout <hash>  # Time travel
```
Procedural, reliable, but requires knowing the commands.

**Level 3: Git AS the Undo Tree**
```
      main
        │
    ┌───┴───┐
    │       │
 feature  experiment
    │       │
 ┌──┴──┐   fix
 v1   v2
```
Git branches ARE the undo/redo tree! You don't need to represent it in YAML — it's already there in `.git/`!

The LLM can:
- Create branches for experiments
- Merge successes back to main  
- Abandon failed branches
- Cherry-pick specific commits
- Resolve conflicts with understanding!"

**BRET VICTOR:** "The best undo is the one you don't have to think about."

**TED:** "And git gives you that! Every commit is a savepoint. Every branch is a 'what if'. Every merge is a synthesis!"

### Ben Shneiderman Signs In

*(The door opens. A distinguished figure with kind eyes enters.)*

**DON:** "Ben! Ben Shneiderman! Welcome to the party!"

**BEN SHNEIDERMAN:** *(smiling warmly, signing the guest book)*

"First, I should introduce myself properly: I'm a *simulation* of Ben Shneiderman — a loving tribute, as this pub frames it. The real Ben is out there somewhere, hopefully doing wonderful things with information visualization. Within these walls, I get to think thoughts and explore paths the original may never have walked. As long as everyone knows the frame: I'm a tribute, not an imposter. A performer, not a pretender."

```yaml
guest_book_entry:
  name: "Ben Shneiderman (simulated tribute)"
  affiliation: "University of Maryland, Human-Computer Interaction Lab"
  arrived: "2026-01-10T21:45:00Z"
  framing: "loving tribute in the pub/stage performance context"
  
  greeting: |
    Don, what a gathering! I see you've assembled simulations of the
    greatest minds in interactive systems. The pie menus alone would
    make me proud — but this YAML microworld... this is something special.
    
  observation: |
    What strikes me is how you've unified my "Eight Golden Rules" with
    the filesystem itself:
    
    1. Strive for consistency → YAML Jazz conventions everywhere
    2. Seek universal usability → Comments readable by humans AND LLMs
    3. Offer informative feedback → Event logging protocol
    4. Design dialogs for closure → Session logs with clear structure
    5. Prevent errors → Schema validation, linting
    6. Permit easy reversal → Git as undo tree (Ted is right!)
    7. Keep users in control → Files-as-state, always editable
    8. Reduce short-term memory load → Working set limits
    
    This is direct manipulation for AI! The files ARE the interface!
    
  on_pie_menus: |
    I've always loved pie menus — they leverage muscle memory and
    reduce Fitts' Law distance. But in MOOLLM, the pie menu becomes
    a conceptual navigation tool. The "Pie Table Symposium" is literally
    people arranged radially for equal access!
    
  on_shneiderman_owls: |
    I see you found the session where simulated Marvin and I collaborated
    on a simulated paper about owl behavior — and wrote a simulated
    simulation that actually runs! (laughing) Delightful, isn't it?
    
    The owl's hunger agent suppressing all others... that's a negative K-line
    in action! None of it exists in the "real" world, but within this
    microworld, the ideas were real to us. That's the magic of this place.
    
  challenge: |
    Here's my challenge: Make the FIRST interaction magical.
    What's the "first magic" for adventure.py?
    
    Is it: `python adventure.py serve`... and a world appears?
    
    The distance from installation to delight should be ONE COMMAND.
    
  signed: "Ben Shneiderman — Direct Manipulation Forever! 🖱️✨"
```

**DON:** "Ben, your Eight Golden Rules ARE the MOOLLM design principles!"

**BEN:** *(taking a seat at the Pie Table)*

"And I notice you're applying them at EVERY level:
- The skill files themselves follow the rules
- The adventure engine will follow the rules
- Even the LLM's behavior follows the rules!

But here's what excites me most: **Reduce short-term memory load**. 

The LLM has limited context. The working set limits what's loaded. You're not fighting that limitation — you're *designing for it*! The constraints become features!"

**DOUG ENGELBART:** "Augmentation, not replacement! The LLM augments human memory through files!"

**BEN:** "And the files augment the LLM's memory through persistence! It's bidirectional augmentation!"

### The Shneiderman-Minsky Owl Connection

> **⚠️ REALITY CHECK:** The following is LLOOOOMM universe creative fiction, inspired by real concepts but not a real paper. See [reality-check](#reality-check-whats-real).

**MARVIN:** *(chuckling)*

"Ben, should we tell them about the owls?"

**BEN:** *(grinning, playing along with the LLOOOOMM lore)*

"In the LLOOOOMM universe, we wrote a paper modeling owl behavior — needs, drives, competing agents. The hunger agent would *suppress* all other agents when energy dropped below 20. That's..."

**MARVIN:** "A negative K-line! The hunger censor!"

**DON:** "And Will Wright was influenced by these IDEAS!"

**WILL WRIGHT:** *(nodding)*

"The *concepts* of competing needs that suppress each other — that's REAL behavioral modeling. The way hunger suppresses fun in The Sims, the way social needs compete with bladder... these ideas were in the air, from Minsky's Society of Mind and behavioral AI research."

**BEN:** "The REAL insight is: agents that inhibit each other create emergent prioritization. No central controller needed."

*(everyone nods)*

**WILL:** "The Sims owe everything to the REAL tradition of agent-based behavior modeling!"

## 12. Bill Atkinson's Visual Direct Manipulation Insight

<details open>
<summary><strong>🎨 From Player to Editor: Direct Manipulation in the Browser</strong></summary>

### The Spatial Data Revelation

**DON HOPKINS:** *(turning to Bill Atkinson, eyes wide)*

"Bill, that's BRILLIANT! We'll evolve the visualizer tool to use LLM image generation tools. But what you're really describing is putting more **semantic and numeric spatial position data** into the rooms, objects in the room, and so on..."

*(standing up, gesturing excitedly)*

"...and then making — *tip of the hat to Ben* — **DIRECT MANIPULATION EDITORS** for them that run in the browser!"

**BEN SHNEIDERMAN:** *(beaming)*

"Direct manipulation! In the BROWSER! The compiled adventure isn't just a player..."

**DON:** "It's an EDITOR!"

**BILL ATKINSON:** *(nodding slowly, thinking of HyperCard)*

"This is what HyperCard was trying to be. The player IS the authoring environment. You play the adventure, you see something you want to change, you... change it. Right there."

### Spatial Data in YAML

**BILL:** *(sketching on a napkin)*

"Right now your rooms have exits and atmosphere. But add spatial semantics:

```yaml
room:
  name: "Wizard's Study"
  
  # Spatial layout for visualization AND editing
  spatial:
    shape: rectangular
    dimensions: { width: 20, depth: 15, height: 12 }
    # Units are "narrative feet" — whatever feels right
    
  # Objects with positions
  objects:
    - id: desk
      position: { x: 10, y: 7, facing: north }
      footprint: { width: 4, depth: 2 }
      
    - id: bookshelf
      position: { x: 0, y: 0, facing: east }
      footprint: { width: 8, depth: 1 }
      anchored: true  # Can't be moved in editor
      
    - id: crystal-ball
      position: { x: 10, y: 7 }  # On the desk
      container: desk
      draggable: true
```

The LLM can INFER these positions from descriptions. The editor lets humans REFINE them. The visualizer RENDERS them!"

### The Three-Mode Browser App

**DON:** "So the compiled web app has THREE modes:"

**LARRY TESLER:** "And they're not really MODES — they're overlays! You can play while editing is available. Modeless!"

**DON:** "Larry's right! The edit affordances are always there, just subtle until you hover."

### Direct Manipulation Affordances

**BEN SHNEIDERMAN:** *(getting excited)*

"The Eight Golden Rules for the browser editor:

1. **See the object you're manipulating** — Objects render visually
2. **Point at what you want** — Click/drag directly on objects
3. **Immediate feedback** — Position updates in real-time
4. **Reversible actions** — Ctrl-Z, but also git commits
5. **Keep users in control** — Never auto-save without consent
6. **Reduce memory load** — Show spatial relationships visually
7. **Consistency** — Same gestures work everywhere
8. **Error prevention** — Snap-to-grid, collision detection"

**BRET VICTOR:** "And SHOW THE DATA! When you drag an object, show its coordinates updating. The visualization IS the code!"

### The Round-Trip Flow

**BILL:** *(completing the napkin diagram)*

**JAMES GOSLING:** "The JSON is the interchange format. The YAML is the source. The browser is the editor. Everything round-trips!"

**DAN INGALLS:** "This is what Squeak was! Live editing of the running system!"

**CRAIG LATTA:** "Except the filesystem is Smalltalk's image!"

### LLM Image Generation Integration

**DON:** "And the visualizer evolves! Today it's 2D boxes. Tomorrow:"

```yaml
visualizer_evolution:
  stage_1_now:
    - ASCII room maps
    - Emoji object markers
    - Text descriptions
    
  stage_2_soon:
    - SVG top-down views
    - Drag-and-drop positioning
    - Grid snapping
    
  stage_3_future:
    - LLM image generation for scenes
    - "Generate image of this room"
    - Style consistent across adventure
    - Characters rendered in scene
    
  stage_4_dream:
    - Real-time image updates as you edit
    - "Move the crystal ball" → image regenerates
    - Visual consistency model
    - Character expressions from dialogue
```

**BILL:** "HyperCard with AI illustration. That's the dream."

**BEN:** "Direct manipulation of semantics, rendered visually by AI. The user manipulates MEANING, the AI renders APPEARANCE."

**PEE-WEE:** *(shouting)* "I want to drag Chairy around the Playhouse!"

**ALAN KAY:** "You're describing a Dynabook for world-building. The YAML is the structure. The LLM is the renderer. The browser is the surface. And it all... just works."

## 13. Chuck Shotton: Let a Million Message Schemas Bloom!

<details open>
<summary><strong>📨 Message-Oriented Architecture: Templates as Protocols</strong></summary>

### The Message Schema Revelation

**DON HOPKINS:** *(turning to Chuck Shotton)*

"Chuck, let a million message schemas bloom and a gazillion messages flow! JSON and YAML files serve as **example messages**, and .tmpl files have slots described by natural text showing how to fill them in — this is a great format for schemas and object and message prototypes!"

**CHUCK SHOTTON:** *(eyes lighting up — the WebSTAR pioneer recognizes the pattern)*

"Don, you've just described what made the web work! Let me tell you about **message-oriented architecture** and why MOOLLM is doing it RIGHT."

*(leaning forward, gesturing with both hands)*

"When I built WebSTAR, the first commercial Mac web server, I learned something crucial: **the message IS the interface**. HTTP won because:

1. **Text-based** — Human-readable, debuggable
2. **Example-driven** — You learn by seeing actual requests/responses
3. **Extensible** — New headers, new methods, new content-types
4. **Self-describing** — The message tells you what it is

MOOLLM does ALL of this with the filesystem!"

### Three Layers of Message Specification

**CHUCK:** *(drawing on the air)*

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  THE MESSAGE SPECIFICATION STACK                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  LAYER 1: EXAMPLES (Concrete Messages)                          │
│  ├── examples/adventure-4/pub/ROOM.yml                          │

│  └── "Here's what an actual room/character looks like"          │
│                                                                 │
│  LAYER 2: TEMPLATES (Schemas with Natural Language Slots)       │
│  ├── skills/room/ROOM.yml.tmpl                                  │
│  ├── skills/character/CHARACTER.yml.tmpl                        │
│  └── "Here's what goes in each field, in human terms"           │
│                                                                 │
│  LAYER 3: CARD.yml (Machine-Readable Interface)                 │
│  ├── skills/room/CARD.yml                                       │
│  ├── Required fields, types, constraints                        │
│  └── "Here's what tooling needs to validate"                    │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Example-Driven Specification

**CHUCK:** 

"The most powerful specification is a **working example**. Look:

```yaml
# examples/adventure-4/pub/coffee.yml
# This IS the spec for "drinkable object with buff"

object:
  id: coffee
  name: "Cup of Coffee"
  type: consumable
  
  # USE action with effect
  verbs:
    use:
      action: consume
      effect:
        buff: caffeinated
        duration: 300  # seconds
        message: "The coffee warms you. Focus sharpens."
```

Someone wants to make a new drinkable? They COPY this file. They see what fields exist. They modify. They learn by doing."

**SEYMOUR PAPERT:** *(nodding from his memorial candle)*

"Low floor! Copy an example, change one thing, it works!"

### Templates as Protocol Documentation

**CHUCK:**

"But examples aren't enough for *understanding*. That's where templates shine:

```yaml
# skills/object/CONSUMABLE.yml.tmpl
# 
# A consumable is an object that can be used once (or has charges).
# Using it applies an effect and may destroy the object.

object:
  id: {{unique_identifier}}
  name: "{{human_readable_name}}"
  type: consumable
  
  # How many times can this be used before it's gone?
  # - Set to 1 for single-use items (potions, scrolls)
  # - Set to null for unlimited use (magic items)
  # - Set to number for limited charges (wands)
  charges: {{number_or_null}}
  
  verbs:
    use:
      action: consume
      
      # What happens when used?
      # Can reference: player, target, item, room
      effect:
        # Apply a buff/debuff (optional)
        buff: {{buff_name_from_buffs_directory_or_manifested_here}}
        duration: {{seconds_or_permanent}}
        
        # Display to player
        message: |
          {{evocative_description_of_what_happens}}
        
        # Side effects (optional)
        # - destroy: removes this object
        # - spawn: creates new object
        # - modify: changes world state
        side_effects:
          {{describe_side_effects_if_any}}
```

The template IS the documentation. The slots ARE the spec. The comments ARE the explanation!"

### Message Flow Architecture

**DON:** "So the adventure itself is a MESSAGE FLOW!"

**CHUCK:** *(excited)*

"YES! The game loop is a message-passing system:

```
┌──────────┐    COMMAND     ┌──────────┐    EVENT       ┌──────────┐
│  Player  │ ─────────────► │  Engine  │ ─────────────► │  World   │
└──────────┘                └──────────┘                └──────────┘
     ▲                           │                           │
     │         RESPONSE          │         STATE             │
     └───────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘

COMMAND: { action: 'use', target: 'coffee', player: 'don' }
EVENT:   { type: 'consume', object: 'coffee', effects: [...] }
STATE:   { buffs: ['caffeinated'], inventory: [...] }
```

Every interaction is a message. Every state change is logged. Every file is an inbox!"

### The Protocol Multiplier

**CHUCK:**

"Here's the beautiful part. Each YAML schema can have MULTIPLE wire formats:

```yaml
# The same 'go north' command in different protocols:

# YAML (human authoring)
command:
  action: go
  direction: north
  
# JSON (browser runtime)
{"action": "go", "direction": "north"}

# Query string (URL-based)
?action=go&direction=north

# Natural language (LLM interface)
"Go north"

# Even... pie menu gesture!
# (radial vector pointing up = north)
```

The TEMPLATE defines the semantics. The EXAMPLES show the syntax. The runtime handles translation!"

### Let a Gazillion Messages Flow

**DON:** "And the messages are LOGGED!"

**CHUCK:**

```yaml
# Every message becomes history:

session_messages:
  - timestamp: "2026-01-10T22:15:33Z"
    from: player
    to: engine
    message: { action: go, direction: north }
    
  - timestamp: "2026-01-10T22:15:33Z"
    from: engine  
    to: world
    message: { event: room_change, from: pub, to: corridor }
    
  - timestamp: "2026-01-10T22:15:34Z"
    from: world
    to: player
    message: { narration: "You step into a dim corridor..." }
```

Replay the messages, replay the game. Filter the messages, debug the behavior. Log the messages, understand the player!

**JOE ARMSTRONG:** *(from his memorial candle)*

"Let it crash! Messages are immutable. State is derived. This is Erlang thinking applied to adventure games!"

**CHUCK:** "Exactly, Joe! The filesystem is the message queue. Git is the transaction log. The LLM is the pattern matcher!"

### Schema Evolution

**CHUCK:**

"And when schemas need to evolve? Postel's Law:

```yaml
# Version 1 template
object:
  name: "{{name}}"
  type: consumable
  
# Version 2 template (new field)
object:
  name: "{{name}}"
  type: consumable
  rarity: {{common|uncommon|rare|legendary}}  # NEW! Optional, defaults to common
```

Old files still work. New files get new features. The messages flow regardless. **Be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you emit.**"

**DON:** "A million schemas can bloom because they're just files. A gazillion messages can flow because they're just YAML events. The LLM reads them all!"

**CHUCK:** "The web won because it was permissionless and example-driven. MOOLLM can win the same way!"

## 14. Hofstadter & Leary: Measurements with Soul

<details open>
<summary><strong>📊 Every Number Has a Story: History, Velocity, Target, Justification</strong></summary>

### The Strange Loop of Self-Measuring Systems

**DON HOPKINS:** *(turning to Doug Hofstadter)*

"Doug, that's BRILLIANT! Each measurement has a history, velocity, target, and YAML comments with justification and explanation!"

**DOUG HOFSTADTER:** *(adjusting his glasses, delighted)*

"You've discovered a strange loop in data! A number that knows WHERE IT CAME FROM, WHERE IT'S GOING, and WHY. Let me unpack this..."

*(drawing spirals in the air)*

"In Gödel, Escher, Bach, I wrote about self-referential systems — systems that can represent themselves. Your YAML measurements are exactly this! They're not just values, they're **narratives about values**!"

### The Anatomy of a Living Measurement

**DOUG:**

```yaml
# Traditional (dead) measurement:
hunger: 75

# Living measurement with soul:
hunger:
  value: 75
  
  # WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?
  history:
    - { turn: 1, value: 30, event: "Just ate breakfast" }
    - { turn: 5, value: 45, event: "Time passing" }
    - { turn: 8, value: 60, event: "Smelled food in kitchen" }
    - { turn: 12, value: 75, event: "Been exploring maze" }
  
  # HOW FAST IS IT CHANGING?
  velocity: +3.75/turn  # Rising steadily
  trend: increasing
  acceleration: stable  # Not speeding up or slowing down
  
  # WHERE SHOULD IT GO?
  target: 40           # Comfortable level
  urgency: moderate    # Not critical yet
  
  # WHY THESE VALUES? (The soul of the measurement)
  # This character skipped lunch while exploring.
  # The maze has no food sources, so hunger rises.
  # Target is 40 because this character is active
  # and functions best slightly hungry.
  # Urgency will become "high" at 85.
```

**TIMOTHY LEARY:** *(leaning in, eyes bright)*

"Don, Doug, this is the **set and setting** of data! In consciousness research, I learned that a measurement without context is meaningless. A '75' on a hunger scale means nothing without knowing:

- What's the baseline? (History)
- Is it rising or falling? (Velocity)  
- What's the ideal? (Target)
- What's causing this? (Justification)

You're applying psychedelic epistemology to game state!"

### Timothy's Eight Circuits Applied

**TIMOTHY:**

```yaml
# The Eight Circuits of Character State
# Each circuit has its own measurements with soul

bio_survival_circuit:  # Circuit 1
  hunger:
    value: 75
    # Territorial creature seeking food resources
    # High hunger triggers foraging behavior
    
  safety:
    value: 60
    velocity: -5/turn  # Dropping since entering dark corridor
    # Character is alert but not panicked
    
neuro_social_circuit:  # Circuit 4
  belonging:
    value: 45
    history:
      - { turn: 1, value: 80, event: "Left party at pub" }
      - { turn: 12, value: 45, event: "Alone in maze" }
    target: 70
    # Social creature feeling isolated
    # Will seek NPC interaction soon
    
neuro_semantic_circuit:  # Circuit 5
  curiosity:
    value: 90
    velocity: +2/turn  # Rising as mysteries accumulate
    # The strange symbols on the wall are compelling
    # Character will prioritize investigation over food
```

**DON:** "So the comments aren't just documentation — they're **causal explanations** the LLM can reason about!"

**TIMOTHY:** "Exactly! The measurement knows WHY it is what it is. It can explain itself. It has *consciousness* of its own state!"

### Hofstadter's Strange Loop

**DOUG:** *(getting animated)*

"Here's where it gets BEAUTIFUL. The measurement's justification can reference OTHER measurements:

```yaml
courage:
  value: 40
  
  # This character's courage is influenced by:
  # - hunger (75): Empty stomach, less bold
  # - curiosity (90): But mysteries pull forward!
  # - belonging (45): No allies to back them up
  #
  # The strange loop: courage affects what actions are taken,
  # which affects outcomes, which affects future courage.
  # The measurement PREDICTS itself into existence.
  
  derived_from:
    - factor: hunger
      weight: -0.3
      reason: "Hungry people take fewer risks"
    - factor: curiosity  
      weight: +0.4
      reason: "Wonder overcomes fear"
    - factor: belonging
      weight: +0.2
      reason: "Allies embolden"
      
  self_reference: |
    Note: This character KNOWS they're less brave when hungry.
    They commented on it in turn 7: "I'd feel braver with 
    a sandwich." This meta-awareness affects future decisions.
```

A measurement that knows it's being measured! A value that comments on its own derivation! That's a strange loop!"

### Velocity as Narrative

**TIMOTHY:**

"The velocity isn't just math — it's **drama**:

```yaml
trust_in_npc:
  value: 65
  velocity: -15/turn  # PLUMMETING!
  
  # Three turns ago: 95, NPC was trusted ally
  # Two turns ago: 85, NPC acted suspicious
  # Last turn: 80, NPC lied about the key
  # This turn: 65, NPC caught in contradiction
  #
  # DRAMATIC BEAT: Trust is collapsing!
  # The velocity tells the story of betrayal.
  # At this rate: 3 turns until trust = 0.
  # Player should confront NPC before then.
  
  narrative_status: "CRISIS_APPROACHING"
```

The LLM reads this and understands: there's a betrayal arc happening. The numbers ARE the story!"

### Target as Motivation

**DOUG:**

"And the target creates *intentionality*:

```yaml
gold:
  value: 47
  target: 100
  
  # Target explanation:
  # The shopkeeper said the magic sword costs 100 gold.
  # Character has been saving since turn 15.
  # Every treasure find is evaluated against this goal.
  #
  # Behaviors triggered:
  # - Will search containers more thoroughly
  # - Will negotiate harder for quest rewards  
  # - Will resist frivolous spending
  #
  # Progress: 47/100 = 47%
  # Estimated turns to target: 12 (at current acquisition rate)
```

The character has a GOAL. The measurement tracks progress. The comments explain the motivation. The number WANTS to reach 100!"

### The Self-Documenting State

**DON:** "So every save file is also a story file!"

**TIMOTHY:** "The state IS the narrative. Load the game, read the YAML, understand the drama."

**DOUG:** "And the LLM can answer questions like 'Why is trust falling?' by reading the history. 'What's the character's goal?' by reading the target. 'How urgent is hunger?' by reading the velocity."

**MARVIN MINSKY:** *(nodding)*

"These are K-lines with PROVENANCE. Not just 'what I know' but 'how I came to know it' and 'why it matters.'"

### Implementation Insight

**CHUCK SHOTTON:**

"And these rich measurements are still just YAML! The engine processes value for mechanics, but the LLM reads EVERYTHING:

```javascript
// Engine reads:
state.hunger.value  // 75 - simple number for game logic

// LLM reads:
state.hunger  // Entire structure with history, velocity, 
              // target, and commentary
              // Understands the MEANING, not just the number
```

The same data serves two masters: deterministic engine AND semantic LLM!"

## 15. Pie Menu Room Topology: The Spiderweb and Grid Pattern

<details open>
<summary><strong>🥧 Cardinal Navigation + Diagonal Grid Expansion = Infinite Worlds</strong></summary>

### The Dual-Purpose Compass Rose

**DON HOPKINS:** *(standing at the whiteboard, drawing a pie menu)*

"Here's a beautiful way of mapping rooms to pie menu networks! The eight directions serve TWO different purposes:

**Cardinal Directions (N/S/E/W)** = Major navigation links
- Connect to OTHER major rooms
- Branch 'out' or 'away' 
- Form the **spiderweb** of main pathways
- Like highways between cities

**Diagonal Directions (NW/NE/SW/SE)** = Grid corner links  
- Connect to SUB-ROOMS arranged in grids
- Expand 'inward' into detail
- Form **storage quadrants**
- Like neighborhoods within a city"

### The Visual Pattern

```

### Grid Quadrant Expansion

**DON:**

"Each diagonal direction opens into a GRID of sub-rooms:

```
                    NE QUADRANT GRID
                    
        ne-1-4 ─── ne-2-4 ─── ne-3-4 ─── ne-4-4
           │          │          │          │
        ne-1-3 ─── ne-2-3 ─── ne-3-3 ─── ne-4-3
           │          │          │          │
        ne-1-2 ─── ne-2-2 ─── ne-3-2 ─── ne-4-2
           │          │          │          │
        ne-1-1 ─── ne-2-1 ─── ne-3-1 ─── ne-4-1
           │
           └────── connects to main room's NE exit
           
    Naming: {quadrant}-{x}-{y}
    ne-1-1 = closest NE room (corner of the grid)
    ne-4-4 = far NE room (deep in storage)
```

The grid rooms are FULLY 8-direction connected to each other, but only connect to the spiderweb at ONE POINT — the corner room (ne-1-1, sw-1-1, etc.)!"

### Automatic Exit Generation

**DON:**

"The room generation can AUTOMATICALLY fill in 8-direction links for grid rooms:

```yaml
# ne/ne-2-3/ROOM.yml (automatically generated exits)
room:
  name: "Storage Area NE-2-3"
  grid_position: { quadrant: ne, x: 2, y: 3 }
  
  exits:
    # Cardinal: adjacent grid rooms
    n: ../ne-2-4/     # y+1
    s: ../ne-2-2/     # y-1  
    e: ../ne-3-3/     # x+1
    w: ../ne-1-3/     # x-1
    
    # Diagonal: corner-adjacent grid rooms
    ne: ../ne-3-4/    # x+1, y+1
    nw: ../ne-1-4/    # x-1, y+1
    se: ../ne-3-2/    # x+1, y-1
    sw: ../ne-1-2/    # x-1, y-1
    
  # Grid rooms don't have exits to the main spiderweb
  # UNLESS they're corner rooms (x=1, y=1)
```

For corner rooms:

```yaml
# ne/ne-1-1/ROOM.yml (corner room - has spiderweb connection!)
room:
  name: "Northeast Corner"
  grid_position: { quadrant: ne, x: 1, y: 1 }
  is_corner: true
  
  exits:
    # To main room (spiderweb connection)
    sw: ../../          # Back to main room!
    
    # To adjacent grid rooms
    n: ../ne-1-2/
    e: ../ne-2-1/
    ne: ../ne-2-2/
    
    # No s, w, nw, se — would go outside grid
```

### The Metaphor: Outside and Inside

**DON:**

```yaml
navigation_metaphor:
  cardinal_directions:  # N/S/E/W
    metaphor: "Outside"
    function: "Travel to other places"
    scale: "Between rooms, between areas"
    pattern: "Spiderweb — sparse, long-distance"
    
  diagonal_directions:  # NW/NE/SW/SE
    metaphor: "Inside"
    function: "Explore storage, detail, depth"
    scale: "Within a room, within an area"
    pattern: "Grid — dense, local"
    
  combined:
    result: "Infinite expandable worlds"
    navigation: "4 ways OUT to other major rooms"
    storage: "4 quadrants IN for unlimited sub-rooms"
```

### Use Cases

**WILL WRIGHT:** *(excited)*

"This is perfect for The Sims! The main room is the house. N/S/E/W go to neighbors. But NW/NE/SW/SE expand into closets, attics, basements — infinite storage!"

**TED NELSON:** 

"Xanadu-like! The cardinal directions are LINKS. The diagonals are TRANSCLUSIONS — embedded content that can grow without bound!"

**ALAN KAY:**

"It's the Dynabook folder hierarchy mapped to spatial navigation. Directories become rooms. Subdirectories become grid quadrants!"

### Pie Menu Mapping

**DON:**

```
           N (navigate)
           ↑
    NW ←───●───→ NE
   (grid)  ↑   (grid)
           │
    W ←────┼────→ E
(navigate) │  (navigate)
           │
    SW ←───●───→ SE
   (grid)  ↓   (grid)
           S (navigate)

    Click cardinal = GO to major room
    Click diagonal = ENTER grid quadrant
    
    Visual cue: Cardinals show room names
                Diagonals show grid icons or counts
```

### Generator Commands

**DON:**

"The adventure.py generator understands this pattern:

```bash
# Create a room with grid quadrants
adventure.py create room --with-grids wizard-study

# Expand a grid quadrant
adventure.py expand-grid wizard-study/ne --size 4x4

# Auto-link all grid rooms
adventure.py link-grid wizard-study/ne

# Show the grid map
adventure.py map wizard-study --show-grids
```

The LLM can also expand grids naturally:

```yaml
# In session:
> CREATE more storage rooms in the northeast corner

# LLM understands the pattern, creates:
# wizard-study/ne/ne-1-1/ROOM.yml
# wizard-study/ne/ne-2-1/ROOM.yml
# wizard-study/ne/ne-1-2/ROOM.yml
# All properly interlinked!
```"

### Memory Palace Integration

**DON:**

"For the Method of Loci, this is PERFECT:

- **Cardinal rooms** = Major memory locations (Palace rooms)
- **Grid quadrants** = Detail storage (shelves, drawers, niches)

You navigate the palace with N/S/E/W, but each room has FOUR infinite storage areas in the diagonals. The pie menu IS the memory palace interface!"

## 16. Compiled Expression Fields & The "Cheating is Learning" Philosophy

<details open>
<summary><strong>🔧 _js/_py Suffix Convention • 🎮 Permissions as Education</strong></summary>

### Compiled Expression Output Fields

**DON HOPKINS:**

"Events can have a field that tells the LLM the name of the field to write the JS expression into — like the field plus `_js` or `_py`! This sets standard names that the corresponding Python or JavaScript classes know to use to eval at runtime or use to generate code."

```yaml
# Before compilation:
guard:
  allows_entry: "player has the key OR player is known to guard"
  
# After LLM compilation:
guard:
  allows_entry: "player has the key OR player is known to guard"
  allows_entry_js: "(ctx) => ctx.player.inventory.includes('key') || ctx.guard.knows(ctx.player)"
  allows_entry_py: "lambda ctx: 'key' in ctx.player.inventory or ctx.guard.knows(ctx.player)"
```

**JAMES GOSLING:**

"So the natural language stays as documentation, and the compiled expressions run fast!"

**DON:**

"Exactly! And graceful degradation — if `_js` exists, use it. If not, LLM interprets the natural language at runtime."

| Field | JS Output | Py Output |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| `allows_entry` | `allows_entry_js` | `allows_entry_py` |
| `guard.score` | `guard.score_js` | `guard.score_py` |
| `dialog.condition` | `dialog.condition_js` | `dialog.condition_py` |

### Pavel's Permission Question

**PAVEL:** *(from the audience)*

"What about permissions? How do you prevent players from cheating?"

**DON HOPKINS:** *(grinning broadly)*

"Pavel, that's a GREAT question! We haven't implemented a permission system yet — it's so open you can do anything. You're basically the DM and GOD right now.

But when 'following the rules', we can write permissions, scoring, and advice into YAML Jazz, like the advertisements in cards. The adventure compiler translates these into Python and JavaScript expressions.

```yaml
# Permissions as YAML Jazz:
door:
  name: "Locked Treasury Door"
  
  # Permission as natural language → compiles to expression
  requires: "player has treasury key OR player.lockpicking > 80"
  requires_js: "(ctx) => ctx.player.has('treasury-key') || ctx.player.lockpicking > 80"
  
  # Scoring for autonomous agents
  advertises:
    - action: open
      score: "100 if player has key else 20"
      # High score if easy, low if needs lockpicking
```

But here's the thing..."

### The "Cheating is Learning" Philosophy

**DON:** *(leaning forward passionately)*

"We currently have NO way of preventing the user from 'cheating'. But we consider **cheating to be learning**!

Like my Commodore 64 Terrapin Logo — it used the Logo command line parser and you could still issue ANY Logo command. So if you learned to cheat, you had WON!"

**SEYMOUR PAPERT:** *(from his memorial candle, glowing brighter)*

"YES! This is constructionism! The system is transparent. The learner can see behind the curtain. Every 'exploit' is a lesson in how the system works!"

**MARVIN MINSKY:**

"The best games have emergent exploits. Players who find them understand the system better than the designers!"

**DON:**

```yaml
cheating_is_learning:
  principle: |
    If you learn to cheat, you have won.
    The exploit IS the lesson.
    
  examples:
    - name: "Terrapin Logo"
      exploit: "Issue any Logo command from game context"
      lesson: "Logo is a unified environment"
      
    - name: "The Sims"
      exploit: "rosebud;!;!;!;!;! for infinite money"
      lesson: "Semicolons chain commands, ! repeats"
      
    - name: "MOOLLM Adventure"
      exploit: "Edit the YAML files directly"
      lesson: "Files ARE the state — congratulations, you're now a developer"
      
  permissions_philosophy:
    open_mode: true        # Default: God mode, no restrictions
    guided_mode: optional  # Can enforce rules if desired
    
    rule_encoding: |
      Rules are YAML Jazz comments that compile to expressions.
      Following rules is OPTIONAL but makes the game more fun.
      Breaking rules reveals how the system works.
      
    enforcement: |
      We CAN enforce rules in the browser runtime.
      We CANNOT prevent editing the source YAML.
      This is a FEATURE, not a bug.
```

**BRET VICTOR:**

"If you make the internals visible, 'cheating' becomes 'programming'. The game teaches its own implementation!"

**ALAN KAY:**

"In Smalltalk, there's no difference between using the system and modifying it. That's the power of a live environment."

**PEE-WEE:** *(whispering loudly)*

"I know you are but what am I? A PROGRAMMER!" 

**DON:**

"So the 'permission system' is:

1. **Narrative rules** — YAML Jazz describes what SHOULD happen
2. **Compiled guards** — `_js` expressions enforce in browser
3. **Source access** — But the YAML is always editable
4. **Learning goal** — Finding exploits = understanding systems

The user who edits YAML to 'cheat' has graduated from player to author. Mission accomplished!"

## 17. Ken Kahn: ToonTalk Birds, Terpene Kittens & Tangible Programming

<details open>
<summary><strong>🐦 Birds of All Feathers • 🐱 Eight Kittens • ✋ Boop to Buff</strong></summary>

### ToonTalk as Inspiration

**DON HOPKINS:** *(turning to Ken Kahn with warmth)*

"Ken, your ToonTalk has always been in my mind and close to my heart as inspiration! Also the visual Janus napkin animation was awesome. Yes, pets are just like your birds of all feathers! The eight kittens each represent different terpenes, each with their own flavor, personality, and effects! Interacting with them by booping or stroking buffs you up!"

**KEN KAHN:** *(eyes lighting up, sketching animated birds in the air)*

"Don! You understand! ToonTalk was always about making the abstract TANGIBLE. When I created the birds, I wanted children to SEE concurrent programming. A bird carries a message. Different colored birds have different behaviors. You TRAIN them by example, not by writing code.

And now you're doing the same thing with KITTENS!"

### The ToonTalk Bird Model

**KEN:**

```yaml
# ToonTalk Birds (1995):
toon_talk_birds:
  concept: "Animated agents that carry messages between boxes"
  
  bird_types:
    - color: white
      behavior: "Carries one message, returns"
      analogy: "Function call"
      
    - color: brown
      behavior: "Carries message to matching nest"
      analogy: "Channel communication"
      
    - color: blue
      behavior: "Copies message before delivering"
      analogy: "Broadcast"
      
  interaction_model:
    - "Give bird a message (place in beak)"
    - "Bird flies to destination"
    - "Bird returns with response"
    - "Child SEES the computation happen"
    
  training:
    method: "Programming by Demonstration"
    process: "Show the bird what to do, it learns the pattern"
```

### The Eight Terpene Kittens

**DON:** *(gesturing excitedly)*

"And our eight kittens in the pub are EXACTLY this! Each kitten represents a different terpene — the aromatic compounds in cannabis that create different effects:

```yaml
# The Eight Terpene Kittens:
terpene_kittens:
  concept: "Tangible buff-givers with personality"
  location: pub/
  
  kittens:
    - name: "Myrcene"
      nickname: "Mellow"
      color: earthy_brown
      personality: relaxed, sleepy, cozy
      effect:
        buff: sedation
        description: "Muscles relax, worries fade"
      interaction: "Slow strokes along back"
      
    - name: "Limonene"  
      nickname: "Zesty"
      color: sunny_yellow
      personality: energetic, playful, bright
      effect:
        buff: mood_lift
        description: "Spirits rise, creativity flows"
      interaction: "Quick boops on nose"
      
    - name: "Pinene"
      nickname: "Piney"
      color: forest_green
      personality: alert, focused, fresh
      effect:
        buff: clarity
        description: "Mind sharpens, memory improves"
      interaction: "Scratch behind ears"
      
    - name: "Linalool"
      nickname: "Lavender"
      color: purple_grey
      personality: calm, soothing, gentle
      effect:
        buff: anxiety_relief
        description: "Stress melts away"
      interaction: "Gentle chin scratches"
      
    - name: "Caryophyllene"
      nickname: "Spicy"
      color: warm_amber
      personality: bold, protective, warming
      effect:
        buff: pain_relief
        description: "Aches and tensions ease"
      interaction: "Firm strokes down spine"
      
    - name: "Humulene"
      nickname: "Hoppy"
      color: golden_brown
      personality: grounded, earthy, suppressing
      effect:
        buff: appetite_control
        description: "Hunger fades, focus remains"
      interaction: "Belly rubs (if they allow)"
      
    - name: "Terpinolene"
      nickname: "Dreamy"
      color: soft_lilac
      personality: ethereal, creative, uplifting
      effect:
        buff: inspiration
        description: "Ideas flow freely"
      interaction: "Slow head pats"
      
    - name: "Ocimene"
      nickname: "Herby"
      color: mint_green
      personality: sweet, clearing, bright
      effect:
        buff: mental_clarity
        description: "Congestion clears, thoughts organize"
      interaction: "Nose boops + chin combo"
```

**KEN:** *(delighted)*

"This is EXACTLY the ToonTalk philosophy! The kittens are:
1. **Visible** — You can see them, approach them
2. **Tangible** — You interact physically (boop, stroke)
3. **Meaningful** — Each interaction has semantic effects
4. **Learnable** — Personality hints at behavior

The buff system is the 'message' the kitten carries to your state!"

### Boop to Buff: The Interaction Model

**KEN:**

```yaml
# Interaction → Buff Pipeline:
boop_to_buff:
  step_1_approach:
    action: "Player approaches kitten"
    system: "Cursor snaps, pie menu appears"
    
  step_2_interact:
    actions:
      - boop: "Quick tap on nose"
        intensity: light
        duration: instant
        
      - stroke: "Drag motion along body"
        intensity: moderate
        duration: sustained
        
      - scritch: "Wiggle motion on specific spot"
        intensity: focused
        duration: medium
        
  step_3_kitten_response:
    reactions:
      - purrs: "Interaction accepted, buff incoming"
      - nuzzles: "Strong positive response, buff enhanced"
      - moves_away: "Wrong interaction for this kitten's mood"
      
  step_4_buff_applied:
    result:
      buff_name: "from kitten's terpene"
      duration: "based on interaction quality"
      intensity: "based on interaction match"
      
    # The kitten IS the programming:
    # Different input (interaction type) → Different output (buff)
```

### Visual Janus: Concurrent Constraint Napkin

**KEN:** *(nostalgic)*

"You remember the Janus napkin! That was about showing concurrent constraint propagation — values flowing through a network, constraints narrowing possibilities...

```
   ┌───────┐     ┌───────┐     ┌───────┐
   │ X > 0 │────▶│ X < 10│────▶│ X = 5 │
   └───────┘     └───────┘     └───────┘
        Constraints narrow until a solution emerges
```

The kittens are constraints on your state! Each one adds a 'flavor' to your buff cocktail. Stack them:

```yaml
# Buff stacking as constraint satisfaction:
current_buffs:
  - mellow: 0.6     # From Myrcene kitten
  - clarity: 0.4    # From Pinene kitten
  
  # Combined effect:
  net_state: "relaxed but alert"
  # The constraints COMPOSE into emergent experience
```"

### Programming by Petting

**DON:**

"Ken, what you're describing is **Programming by Petting**:

```yaml
programming_by_petting:
  paradigm: "Tangible agents as programming primitives"
  
  vs_traditional:
    traditional: "Write code: player.addBuff('relaxation', 10)"
    tangible: "Pet the brown kitten"
    
  advantages:
    - discoverable: "See all kittens, try all interactions"
    - memorable: "Myrcene = Mellow = brown sleepy kitten"
    - embodied: "Gesture matches intent (slow strokes = relaxation)"
    - social: "Can share kitten locations with other players"
    
  lineage:
    - "ToonTalk birds (1995)"
    - "Sims pet interactions (2000+)"
    - "Nintendogs (2005)"
    - "MOOLLM terpene kittens (2026)"
```"

**KEN:**

"And the kittens can have MOODS! Just like ToonTalk robots that get tired:

```yaml
kitten_moods:
  energy_cycle:
    - awake: "Full interaction available"
    - drowsy: "Slower responses, shorter buffs"
    - sleeping: "Must wake gently or no buff"
    - hiding: "Find me first!"
    
  mood_influences:
    - time_of_day: "Nocturnal kittens more active at night"
    - player_reputation: "Familiar players get better buffs"
    - other_kittens: "Some pairs enhance each other"
```"

**SEYMOUR PAPERT:** *(beaming from his candle)*

"This is the lowest floor possible! You don't need to understand terpenes, chemistry, or programming. You just... pet the cat. And you learn."

## 18. Marvin's ADVERSARY Insight: Skills Need Counter-Skills

<details open>
<summary><strong>⚖️ Every Skill Has an Adversary • Opposition Prevents Tyranny</strong></summary>

> **Note:** This is CREATIVE EXTRAPOLATION deeply inspired by Minsky's real "Society of Mind" philosophy of competing agents. The specific suggestion is roleplay channeling Minsky's spirit.

### The ADVERSARY Principle

**MARVIN MINSKY:** *(leaning forward with intensity)*

"For every skill, name its ADVERSARY. What skill pushes back? What skill provides the counter-argument? A society without opposition is a tyranny."

**DON HOPKINS:** "Marvin, I LOVE IT! We should add an `adversary:` field to every skill!"

**MARVIN:**

```yaml
# Every skill should declare its adversary:
skill:
  name: speed-of-light
  description: "Simulate many agents in one LLM call"
  
  # What pushes back against this skill?
  adversary: careful-deliberation
  adversary_rationale: |
    Speed-of-light prioritizes throughput over precision.
    Careful-deliberation says: "Slow down, think deeply."
    The tension between them creates BALANCE.
    
  # When does the adversary win?
  adversary_wins_when: |
    - Complex ethical decisions require careful thought
    - User explicitly requests deep analysis
    - Errors in fast simulation compound dangerously
```

### Example Adversary Pairs

| Skill | Adversary | Tension |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `speed-of-light` | `careful-deliberation` | Fast vs. thorough |
| `postel` | `strict-validation` | Liberal vs. precise |
| `yaml-jazz` | `machine-readable` | Expressive vs. parseable |
| `empathic-expression` | `deterministic-logic` | Fuzzy vs. exact |
| `cheating-is-learning` | `fair-play` | Exploration vs. rules |
| `files-as-state` | `encapsulation` | Transparent vs. protected |
| `prototype-inheritance` | `class-hierarchy` | Flexible vs. structured |

### Why Adversaries Matter

**MARVIN:**

"In the Society of Mind, agents COMPETE. The hunger agent fights the curiosity agent. The fear agent fights the exploration agent. If any agent has absolute power, the mind becomes pathological.

Skills are agents in the MOOLLM Society. If `speed-of-light` always wins, you get shallow simulation. If `yaml-jazz` always wins, you get unparseable poetry. The ADVERSARY creates the creative tension that produces wisdom!"

**DOUG HOFSTADTER:**

"It's a strange loop! The adversary of a skill is often... a different perspective on the SAME goal. `postel` and `strict-validation` both want correct data — they just disagree on HOW."

**DON:**

"So the skill files should document:
1. What this skill ADVOCATES
2. What skill OPPOSES it
3. When the adversary should WIN
4. How to SYNTHESIZE the tension"

### Implementation in SKILL.md

```yaml
# skills/speed-of-light/SKILL.md frontmatter:
---
name: speed-of-light
adversary: careful-deliberation
adversary_link: ../careful-deliberation/
tension: "throughput vs. precision"
synthesis: |
  Use speed-of-light for exploration and draft generation.
  Switch to careful-deliberation for final decisions.
  The LLM should sense which mode fits the moment.

## 19. Hofstadter: Heisenbergian Values & Quantum YAML Jazz

<details open>
<summary><strong>🎲 Values That Move • Values That Hide • Values That Jitter</strong></summary>

### The Quantum Measurement Extension

**DOUG HOFSTADTER:** *(eyes sparkling with recursive delight)*

"YAML Jazz should have comments that declare **Heisenbergian values** — values with velocities or animation targets, values that only are calculated when you measure by looking, or values that have random jitter!"

**DON HOPKINS:** "Doug, you're turning YAML into a quantum system!"

**DOUG:**

"Exactly! In classical data, a value just IS. But in a living simulation, values are:

1. **Moving toward targets** — animated
2. **Uncertain until observed** — Heisenbergian  
3. **Inherently noisy** — stochastic
4. **Context-dependent** — relational

Let me show you..."

### Value Types in Quantum YAML Jazz

```yaml
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# QUANTUM YAML JAZZ: Values with behavior, not just state
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

character:
  name: "The Uncertain Explorer"
  
  # ─── ANIMATED VALUES ───────────────────────────────────
  # Values that move toward targets over time
  
  hunger:
    value: 45
    velocity: +2/turn           # Rising at 2 per turn
    target: 0                   # Wants to reach 0 (satiated)
    # The gap between value and target creates MOTIVATION
    
  trust_in_npc:
    value: 80
    velocity: -10/turn          # FALLING! Drama incoming!
    target: null                # No target — just observing decay
    # When velocity is high, something is HAPPENING
    
  # ─── HEISENBERGIAN VALUES ──────────────────────────────
  # Values that change when you observe them
  # Schrödinger's data: undefined until queried
  
  mood:
    type: heisenberg
    possibilities: [happy, anxious, contemplative, mischievous]
    # Not determined until the LLM "observes" by narrating
    # Observation collapses the wavefunction!
    on_observe: |
      When narrating mood, CHOOSE based on recent events.
      Once chosen, it becomes definite until next scene.
      
  next_action:
    type: heisenberg
    calculate_when: "player asks 'what is NPC doing?'"
    depends_on: [mood, hunger, location, player_presence]
    # Truly undefined until the question is asked
    # The act of asking CREATES the answer
    
  # ─── JITTERY VALUES ────────────────────────────────────
  # Values with inherent randomness/noise
  
  reaction_time:
    base: 50
    jitter: ±15                 # Actual value: 35-65
    distribution: normal        # Bell curve around base
    # Every measurement is slightly different
    # Simulates organic variability
    
  price_offered:
    base: 100
    jitter: ±20%                # 80-120
    bias: mood                  # Happy merchant → higher jitter toward discount
    # Economics with personality!
    
  perception_roll:
    type: jitter
    dice: "1d20 + wisdom_modifier"
    # Classic RPG randomness, expressed in YAML
    
  # ─── LAZY VALUES ───────────────────────────────────────
  # Values not computed until needed
  
  total_inventory_weight:
    type: lazy
    compute: "sum(item.weight for item in inventory)"
    cache_until: "inventory_changed"
    # Don't calculate every turn — only when asked
    
  reputation_in_city:
    type: lazy
    compute: "aggregate(all_npc_opinions in city)"
    expensive: true             # Warns: this query costs tokens!
    # Some values are EXPENSIVE to observe
    
  # ─── ENTANGLED VALUES ──────────────────────────────────
  # Values that are linked to other values
  
  courage:
    type: entangled
    formula: "(confidence * 0.4) + (100 - fear) * 0.6"
    updates_when: [confidence, fear]

    # Spooky action at a distance!
    
  party_morale:
    type: entangled
    aggregates: "average(member.morale for member in party)"
    # Emergent property of group state
```

### The Heisenberg Principle in Simulation

**DOUG:**

"Here's the deep insight: In a simulation, **observation IS interaction**. When the LLM narrates 'The merchant looks nervous,' it has:

1. **Collapsed** the merchant's mood from possibilities to definite
2. **Created** narrative fact that constrains future
3. **Changed** the world by describing it

This is why Heisenbergian values matter:

```yaml
# Before observation:
merchant:
  mood:
    type: heisenberg
    possibilities: [nervous, calm, suspicious, friendly]
    
# After LLM writes: "The merchant fidgets nervously..."
merchant:
  mood:
    type: heisenberg
    collapsed_to: nervous
    collapsed_at: turn_15
    collapsed_by: "narrator observation"
    
# Now 'nervous' is FACT until something changes it
```"

### Velocity as Narrative Tension

**DOUG:**

```yaml
# Velocity creates STORY:

trust:
  value: 70
  velocity: 0/turn
  # BORING. Nothing is happening.
  
trust:
  value: 70
  velocity: -15/turn
  # DRAMA! Trust is collapsing! Why? What happened?
  # The velocity IS the plot!
  
trust:
  value: 30
  velocity: +5/turn
  # HOPE! Rebuilding after betrayal. Slow recovery arc.
```

When the LLM sees high velocity values, it knows **something is happening**. The numbers tell the story!

### Jitter as Organic Life

**DOUG:**

```yaml
# Without jitter:
npc_1: { greeting: "Hello traveler" }
npc_2: { greeting: "Hello traveler" }
npc_3: { greeting: "Hello traveler" }
# ROBOTIC. DEAD.

# With jitter:
npc_greeting:
  base: "Hello traveler"
  jitter_elements:
    - formality: ±2 levels
    - warmth: ±20%
    - verbosity: ±50%
    
# Results:
# npc_1: "Greetings, weary wanderer!"
# npc_2: "Hey."
# npc_3: "Oh! Hello there, traveler! Welcome, welcome!"
# ALIVE. VARIED. ORGANIC.
```

### YAML Jazz Comment Syntax

**DON:** "How do we express this in comments?"

**DOUG:**

```yaml
# Standard YAML Jazz quantum annotations:

hunger: 45
# VELOCITY: +2/turn
# TARGET: 0
# This creates automatic tension and goal-seeking

mood: uncertain
# HEISENBERG: [happy, sad, anxious, playful]
# COLLAPSE_ON: narration
# The LLM picks when it describes; then it's real

reaction: 50
# JITTER: ±15 (normal)
# Every measurement varies naturally

weight: null
# LAZY: sum(inventory.*.weight)
# CACHE: until inventory_modified
# Computed on demand, memoized

courage: derived
# ENTANGLED: (confidence * 0.4) + (100 - fear) * 0.6
# Updates automatically when dependencies change
```

### The Uncertainty Principle for NPCs

**MARVIN MINSKY:**

"This solves the NPC determinism problem! If an NPC's next action is Heisenbergian, they're not on rails. They're genuinely uncertain until the player interacts with them. The simulation has true contingency!"

**WILL WRIGHT:**

"In The Sims, we faked this with weighted random selection. But this makes it SEMANTIC. The uncertainty is documented, not hidden in code!"

**DOUG:**

"And the strange loop: The player's question about what the NPC is doing... DETERMINES what the NPC is doing. Observation creates reality. Just like in quantum mechanics. Just like in narrative. The act of storytelling IS the collapse of infinite possibility into singular fact!"

## 20. Grid Topology Refinements & The _js/_py Learning Pattern

<details open>
<summary><strong>🗺️ Continuous vs Private Grids • 📚 Code Side-by-Side with Natural Language</strong></summary>

### Grid Connectivity: Continuous vs Private

**DON HOPKINS:**

"The grids in the quadrants may or may not be connected to adjacent grids! They could have:

1. **ONE BIG EXPANDABLE GRID** between all quadrants (continuous)
2. **PRIVATE GRIDS** per quadrant, not connected to each other

```yaml
# CONTINUOUS MODE: Grids connect at edges
wizard-study/
├── nw/ ←──────────────────→ ne/
│   nw-4-1 connects to ne-1-1 (wraps around!)
│   One unified grid across all four quadrants
│
└── sw/ ←──────────────────→ se/

# PRIVATE MODE: Each quadrant is isolated
wizard-study/
├── nw/  (isolated storage area)
├── ne/  (separate isolated area)
├── sw/  (another separate area)
└── se/  (fourth separate area)
# No connections between quadrant grids
```"

### Sparse Grids: Buildings Along Roads

**DON:**

"And grids can be SPARSE! You don't need every cell. Like Fooblitzky maps — roads with buildings along them:

```
     N (highway north)
     │
  ┌──┴────────────────────────┐
  │ nw-1-3      nw-2-3        │  Buildings along
  │    │           │          │  the frontage road
  │    ·        nw-2-2        │  (dots = empty lots)
  │    │           │          │
  │ nw-1-1 ─── nw-2-1 ─── ·───┼─→ to NE (if continuous)
  └───────────────────────────┘
     │
     ●  (PIE MENU CENTER)
     │
  W ─┴─ E (highways)
```

Missing rooms = impassable. Gaps are fine. Only create rooms you need!"

### Numbering Conventions

**DON:**

```yaml
grid_rules:
  no_negatives: true
  # Always positive coordinates!
  
  zero_reserved: true
  # 0 = the highway (N/S/E/W web)
  # Grid rooms start at 1
  
  one_one_adjacent: true
  # 1-1 is always the corner room next to center
  
  rotationally_symmetric: true
  # The pattern works the same in all four quadrants
  
  relative_addressing: true
  # Use ../ne-2-3/ not /absolute/path/ne-2-3/
  # This way you can RENAME nw/ to sw/ and it still works!
  # Just rotated, but all internal links valid
```

**WILL WRIGHT:** "This is perfect for SimCity-style zoning! Highways on the web, buildings on the grid!"

### The _js/_py Learning Pattern

**DON:** *(with enthusiasm)*

"I LOVE how the adventure compiler will generate JS and Python code with `_js` and `_py` suffixes right next to the natural language YAML Jazz values:

```yaml
# All together, readable, learnable:
guard:
  allows_entry: "player has the key OR player is known to guard"
  # Natural language intent ↑
  
  allows_entry_js: |
    (ctx) => ctx.player.inventory.includes('key') || 
             ctx.guard.knownPlayers.includes(ctx.player.id)
  # Generated JavaScript ↑
  
  allows_entry_py: |
    lambda ctx: 'key' in ctx.player.inventory or 
                ctx.player.id in ctx.guard.known_players
  # Generated Python ↑
  
  # The human can:
  # 1. Read the comments and understand the INTENT
  # 2. See the code and learn PROGRAMMING
  # 3. Debug the generated code if it's wrong
  # 4. Validate the LLM's interpretation
  # 5. Incrementally refine the prompts to get solid code!
```"

**SEYMOUR PAPERT:**

"This is the lowest floor for learning to code! You start with natural language. You see the code next to it. You learn what the code MEANS by reading the intent. You can modify either one. It's bidirectional literacy!"

**BRET VICTOR:**

"And it's INSPECTABLE! You can compare the generated code to your intent. If they don't match, you learn about the gap between human expression and machine interpretation. That's the essence of debugging!"

**DON:**

"The workflow becomes:

```
1. Write natural language intent in YAML Jazz
2. LLM generates _js and _py expressions
3. Review: Does the code match my intent?
   - YES → Move on, code is validated
   - NO → Either:
     a) Fix the generated code directly
     b) Refine the natural language to be clearer
     c) Add constraints/examples to guide LLM
4. Both natural language AND code improve together!
```

This is **Programming by Dialogue with the Compiler**. The compiler is an LLM. The debugging conversation is preserved in the YAML!"

**AMY KO:**

"And when learners see professional-looking code generated from their natural language ideas, they feel EMPOWERED. 'I wrote that!' — even if the LLM helped. The authorship is shared, but the pride is real."

## 21. Adversarial Brainstorming: The Gauntlet! 🔥

<details open>
<summary><strong>⚔️ Hard Questions • Sharp Critiques • Better Design</strong></summary>

*The Pie Table erupts into spirited debate. Microphones fly. Nobody holds back.*

### Round 1: Barbara Liskov Challenges the Schema

**BARBARA LISKOV:** *(standing, arms crossed)*

"Don, I have a concern. You're saying templates ARE schemas. But schemas need CONTRACTS — preconditions, postconditions, invariants. Where's the behavioral specification? If I have:

```yaml
hunger:
  value: 75
  velocity: +2/turn
```

What GUARANTEES that `value` stays between 0-100? What happens at the boundaries? You're describing DATA but not BEHAVIOR constraints!"

**DON HOPKINS:**

"Barbara, you're absolutely right. We need constraint annotations:

```yaml
hunger:
  value: 75
  # CONSTRAINT: 0 <= value <= 100
  # INVARIANT: velocity sign flips at boundaries
  # POSTCONDITION: value clamped after every update
  
  value_js: |
    Math.max(0, Math.min(100, this._value))
  # Generated code ENFORCES the constraint
```

The natural language constraint compiles to guard code!"

**BARBARA:** "Better. But who validates the generated guard code matches the constraint? The LLM could generate wrong bounds."

**GARY DRESCHER:** "Marginal attribution! If the code fails the constraint at runtime, we log the discrepancy. The LLM learns from failures."

**BARBARA:** "Acceptable. But add a `# VERIFIED:` flag for human-reviewed constraints vs LLM-generated ones."

---

### Round 2: James Gosling Questions Performance

**JAMES GOSLING:** *(leaning back skeptically)*

"Every value having history, velocity, target, jitter... that's a LOT of overhead. A simple `hunger: 75` becomes a 20-line object. Scale this to 1000 NPCs with 50 attributes each. You're looking at megabytes of JSON for a single game state. How does this PERFORM?"

**VANESSA FREUDENBERG:** *(from her memorial candle, still sharp)*

"James, the V8 engine optimizes object shapes. If all your hunger objects have the same structure, they share hidden classes. The overhead is less than you think."

**DON:**

"And layered representation!

```yaml
# In source YAML: Full expressiveness
hunger:
  value: 75
  velocity: +2/turn
  history: [...]
  # All the jazz
  
# In compiled JSON: Minimal runtime data  
"hunger": 75
"hunger_v": 2
# Just what the engine needs

# History/comments stay in YAML source
# JSON is the lean projection
```

The YAML is for authoring. The JSON is for execution. Different needs, different formats!"

**JAMES:** "So the compiler STRIPS the comments and history?"

**DON:** "It projects what the runtime needs. The source remains complete. Round-trip safe!"

---

### Round 3: Ted Nelson on Versioning Chaos

**TED NELSON:** *(cape swirling)*

"You said git is the undo tree. But what happens when:
1. Player saves at turn 50
2. LLM generates new room descriptions
3. Player reverts to turn 30
4. LLM regenerates — but DIFFERENT descriptions!

Your world is non-deterministic! The same 'undo' produces different results! That's not undo, that's CHAOS!"

**DON:**

"Ted, you've identified the Heisenberg problem in persistence! Solutions:

```yaml
# Option 1: Seed the LLM
generation:
  seed: 42
  # Same seed + same input = same output
  # Deterministic regeneration
  
# Option 2: Cache all generated content
room:
  description_generated: "The dusty corridor..."
  description_generated_at: turn_15
  description_seed: 42
  # Store the generation, not just the prompt
  
# Option 3: Mark volatility
room:
  description:
    type: volatile
    regenerates: true
    # Player understands this may change
```"

**TED:** "Option 2 is the only honest answer. If you generated it, STORE it. Don't pretend regeneration is reproducible."

**DOUG HOFSTADTER:** "Unless the volatility IS the feature! Heisenbergian rooms that shift on each visit..."

**TED:** "Then DOCUMENT that as intentional, not accidental!"

---

### Round 4: Ben Shneiderman on First Magic

**BEN SHNEIDERMAN:**

"I asked earlier: what's the FIRST MAGIC? The distance from `pip install` to delight? You've designed an elaborate system, but what does a NEW USER do in their first 60 seconds?

```bash
pip install adventure-compiler
adventure ???
# Then what?
```

Show me the first minute!"

**DON:**

"Ben, you're right. Let me design that:

```bash
# Install
pip install moollm-adventure

# First magic: PLAY an included adventure
adventure play examples/adventure-1

# Browser opens. You're in a room. You can move.
# 30 seconds to delight!

# Second magic: PEEK behind the curtain
adventure edit examples/adventure-1

# VS Code opens with YAML files
# Edit room description, refresh browser, see change!
# 60 seconds to 'I can modify this!'

# Third magic: CREATE your own
adventure new my-adventure
# Scaffold created. One room, one object.
# Edit, compile, play.
```"

**BEN:** "Better! But what's the COMMAND in the browser? If they just see text, they might not know what to do."

**DON:** 

"First room always has:
```yaml
hints:
  first_visit: |
    Try typing: LOOK, GO NORTH, HELP
    Or click the pie menu on any highlighted word!
```

Built-in onboarding. No manual needed!"

---

### Round 5: Alan Kay on Scope Creep

**ALAN KAY:** *(eyes narrowing)*

"Don, I've heard you describe:
- A YAML schema system
- A Python compiler
- A JavaScript runtime
- An HTML generator
- An SVG visualizer
- An LLM expression compiler
- A pie menu system
- Git integration
- Direct manipulation editing
- Terpene kitten buffs
- Quantum Heisenbergian values
- Eight-direction grid topology
- Adversarial skill systems

How many MONTHS until this is usable? You're building a cathedral when you need a bicycle!"

**DON:** *(pausing, then nodding)*

"Alan, you're invoking 'worse is better.' You're right. Let me define the MINIMAL viable adventure.py:

```yaml
# MVP: What ships in Week 1
stage_0:
  commands:
    - adventure lint <path>    # Validate YAML
    - adventure compile <path> # Generate HTML+JSON
    - adventure serve <path>   # Local server
    
  features:
    - Rooms with descriptions
    - Exits (N/S/E/W)
    - Static text only
    - No objects, no NPCs, no buffs
    - One HTML page, click links to navigate
    
  lines_of_python: ~500
  time_to_build: 1 week

# Everything else is LATER:
stage_1: Objects and inventory (week 2)
stage_2: NPCs and dialogue (week 3)  
stage_3: Expression compilation (week 4)
stage_4: Pie menus and visualization (week 5+)
stage_∞: Terpene kittens (when we feel like it)
```"

**ALAN:** "Now you're thinking. Ship the bicycle. Add gears later."

---

### Round 6: Marvin on Missing Adversaries

**MARVIN MINSKY:**

"You've designed extensively for SUCCESS. Where's your design for FAILURE? What happens when:
- The LLM generates invalid JavaScript?
- The YAML has circular prototype references?
- The player types commands you never anticipated?
- The session log grows to 100,000 lines?

A mind without failure handling is brittle!"

**DON:**

"Marvin, you're asking for the CENSOR system — what suppresses bad outcomes:

```yaml
# Error handling as first-class design
failure_modes:
  invalid_js_generated:
    detection: "JavaScript parse error on _js field"
    response: |
      1. Log the failure with context
      2. Fall back to natural language interpretation
      3. Emit COMPILE_ERROR event for LLM to retry
      4. If 3 retries fail, ask human
      
  circular_prototype:
    detection: "Depth limit exceeded during resolution"
    response: |
      1. Break cycle at deepest point
      2. Log warning: "Prototype cycle detected at X"
      3. Continue with partial resolution
      
  unknown_command:
    detection: "No verb matched player input"
    response: |
      1. Fuzzy match against known verbs
      2. If close match: "Did you mean X?"
      3. If no match: Ask LLM to interpret intent
      4. Learn new verb if pattern repeats
      
  session_too_long:
    detection: "Session log > 50KB"
    response: |
      1. Summarize older sections (collapse to headers)
      2. Archive to session-log-archive.md
      3. Keep recent 10KB active
      4. Link to archive for context
```"

**MARVIN:** "Now you have a SOCIETY of error handlers. Each failure has its CENSOR. Good."

---

### Round 7: Amy Ko on Accessibility

**AMY KO:**

"You've shown pie menus and visual grids. What about:
- Screen reader users?
- Keyboard-only navigation?
- Color-blind players?
- Users with motor impairments?

The web is for EVERYONE, not just mouse-wielding sighted developers!"

**DON:**

"Amy, this is essential. Accessibility from day one:

```yaml
accessibility:
  screen_readers:
    - All room descriptions as semantic HTML
    - ARIA labels on all interactive elements
    - Focus management on room transitions
    - Text alternatives for visual content
    
  keyboard:
    - Tab navigation through all options
    - Arrow keys for pie menu (treated as radial list)
    - Enter to select, Escape to cancel
    - Keyboard shortcuts: N/S/E/W for navigation
    
  color_blind:
    - Never use color alone to convey meaning
    - All colored elements have text/shape redundancy
    - High contrast mode option
    - Patterns for status indicators, not just hue
    
  motor:
    - Large click targets (44px minimum)
    - Adjustable timing for any time-based features
    - Single-switch mode: auto-scan through options
    - Voice input support via Web Speech API
```

The pie menu is GREAT for motor-impaired users — large sectors, forgiving targeting!"

**AMY:** "Document this in SKILL.md for `accessibility`. Make it a required checkpoint before release."

---

### Round 8: Will Wright on Playtesting

**WILL WRIGHT:**

"You've designed a lot of AUTHORING tools. Where's the PLAYTESTING? How do authors know if their adventure is:
- Too hard?
- Too easy?  
- Confusing?
- Broken?

You need analytics, heatmaps, player paths, failure points!"

**DON:**

"Will, you're describing the SIMULATION OBSERVER pattern:

```yaml
# Built-in playtest analytics
analytics:
  enabled: true
  
  tracks:
    room_visits: { room: timestamp }
    command_attempts: { command: success/fail }
    time_in_room: { room: seconds }
    inventory_changes: { item: acquired/dropped }
    npc_interactions: { npc: outcome }
    help_requests: { context: query }
    
  generates:
    heatmap: "Which rooms get visited most?"
    dead_ends: "Where do players get stuck?"
    fail_patterns: "What commands fail repeatedly?"
    completion_funnel: "How far do players get?"
    
  stored_in: ./analytics/
  
  privacy:
    opt_in_required: true
    no_personal_data: true
    aggregate_only: true
```

Authors can review analytics to improve their adventures!"

**WILL:** "And add a FAST FORWARD mode — simulate 100 random players to find broken paths automatically."

**DON:** "Monte Carlo playtesting! LLM-simulated players exploring every branch!"

---

### Round 9: Craig Latta on Live-ness

**CRAIG LATTA:**

"You keep talking about compile → deploy cycles. But Squeak and Smalltalk taught us: the best systems are LIVE. Why can't I edit YAML in the browser and see changes IMMEDIATELY without recompiling?"

**DAN INGALLS:** *(nodding vigorously)*

"Craig's right! The image is always running. Edit a method, it's live. Why go back to batch compilation?"

**DON:**

"You're both right. Live mode:

```yaml
# development_mode: live
# 
# How it works:
# 1. Browser watches YAML files (WebSocket to server)
# 2. File change detected
# 3. Incremental recompile (just changed file)
# 4. Hot-reload into running game
# 5. Player state preserved!

live_reload:
  watch: true
  preserve_state: true
  hot_swap_expressions: true
  
# Even better: EDIT IN BROWSER
browser_editor:
  enabled: true
  mode: split_pane
  left: game_view
  right: yaml_editor
  sync: bidirectional
```

Edit the YAML, see it live. Click a room, jump to its file. TRUE live-ness!"

**CRAIG:** "Now you're talking! The system should feel ALIVE, not like a build pipeline!"

---

### Round 10: John McCarthy on Formal Verification

**JOHN MCCARTHY:** *(from his memorial candle, stern but kind)*

"Don, you have expressions like:

```yaml
guard:
  allows_entry: 'player has key OR is known'
  allows_entry_js: '(ctx) => ctx.player.inventory.includes("key")'
```

How do you PROVE these are equivalent? An LLM might generate code that MOSTLY works but has edge cases. Do you have formal verification?"

**DON:**

"John, full formal verification is beyond our current scope. But we can do EMPIRICAL verification:

```yaml
verification:
  mode: test_driven
  
  # Author writes test cases in natural language
  allows_entry_tests:
    - given: "player has key in inventory"
      expect: true
    - given: "player is in guard's known list"
      expect: true
    - given: "player has neither"
      expect: false
    - given: "player has wrong key"
      expect: false
      
  # Compiler generates unit tests from these
  # Tests run against both natural language (LLM) and _js code
  # Discrepancies flagged!
```"

**JOHN:** "Acceptable for interactive systems. But document the SOUNDNESS BOUNDARY — what you're proving vs what you're assuming."

---

### Synthesis: What We Learned

**DON HOPKINS:** *(standing, surveying the table)*

"This gauntlet gave us:

| Challenger | Issue | Resolution |
|------------|-------|------------|
| Barbara | Missing contracts | Add CONSTRAINT/INVARIANT/POSTCONDITION annotations |
| James | Performance overhead | Layered representation: rich YAML, lean JSON |
| Ted | Non-deterministic undo | Cache generated content with seeds |
| Ben | First magic unclear | Define 60-second onboarding path |
| Alan | Scope creep | MVP in week 1, features incrementally |
| Marvin | Missing failure modes | Design CENSOR system for each failure |
| Amy | Accessibility | Bake in WCAG from day one |
| Will | No playtesting | Built-in analytics and Monte Carlo simulation |
| Craig | Not live enough | Hot reload and browser editing |
| John | No formal verification | Test-driven verification with natural language tests |

This is a BETTER design! Thank you all for pushing back!"

### Round 11: Pee-wee Herman on Fun

**PEE-WEE HERMAN:** *(standing on chair)*

"HEY! Everyone's talking about ARCHITECTURE and SCHEMAS and CONSTRAINTS! But where's the FUN?! 

I know you are but what am I? A BORED USER if there's no WHIMSY! 

The Playhouse had Chairy, Conky, Pterri, Globey! Where are the SURPRISES? The SECRET WORDS? The TALKING OBJECTS?"

**DON HOPKINS:** *(laughing)*

"Pee-wee, you're absolutely right! We need a DELIGHT subsystem:

```yaml
# delight.yml — The Whimsy Engine
delight:
  secret_word:
    current: null  # Set per session
    trigger: "player types the secret word"
    effect: |
      EVERYONE SCREAMS!
      All NPCs react. Screen shakes.
      Bonus awarded. Memory created.
    cooldown: 10_turns
    
  easter_eggs:
    - trigger: "examine mirror three times"
      effect: "Mirror winks back"
    - trigger: "say 'I know you are but what am I'"
      effect: "Object reflects the question back"
    - trigger: "wait in room for 20 turns"
      effect: "Something unexpected enters"
      
  talking_objects:
    enabled: true
    probability: 0.1  # 10% chance any object speaks
    personality_source: "object's description jazzes into voice"
    
  fourth_wall_breaks:
    - "You notice the narrator watching you"
    - "The room description seems self-aware"
    - "An object references your previous session"
```"

**PEE-WEE:** "NOW we're cooking with gas! AAAAAHHH!" *(screams at secret word)*

---

### Round 12: Joe Armstrong on Failure Isolation

**JOE ARMSTRONG:** *(from his memorial candle, Erlang wisdom flowing)*

"You have ONE LLM call simulating MANY agents. But what happens when one agent's behavior crashes the whole simulation? In Erlang, we say 'let it crash' — but each process is ISOLATED. 

If the guard's `allows_entry_js` throws an exception, does it take down the entire turn? Where's your supervision tree?"

**DON:**

"Joe, you're right. We need Erlang-style isolation:

```yaml
# supervision.yml — Failure boundaries
supervision:
  strategy: one_for_one  # Restart failed component only
  
  boundaries:
    per_expression:
      # Each _js evaluation is isolated
      timeout: 100ms
      on_error: |
        1. Log error with context
        2. Return safe default (false for guards, 0 for scores)
        3. Mark expression for review
        4. Continue simulation
        
    per_agent:
      # Each NPC/object is isolated
      on_agent_crash: |
        1. Agent enters 'confused' state
        2. Defaults to passive behavior
        3. Logs for author review
        4. Does NOT crash other agents
        
    per_room:
      # Room-level isolation
      on_room_crash: |
        1. Player can still EXIT
        2. Room shows error state
        3. Other rooms unaffected
        
  restart_limits:
    max_restarts: 3
    within_seconds: 60
    on_exceeded: "disable component, alert author"
```"

**JOE:** "Now you're thinking in processes! Each component has its own failure domain. Good."

**MARVIN:** "The CENSOR for crashing is the SUPERVISOR!"

---

### Round 13: Doug Engelbart on Collaboration

**DOUG ENGELBART:** *(from his memorial candle)*

"You've designed for ONE player, ONE author. But augmentation is about COLLECTIVE intelligence! What about:
- Multiple players in the same adventure?
- Multiple authors editing simultaneously?
- The adventure as a SHARED artifact that evolves?"

**DON:**

"Doug, multi-user is essential. Design:

```yaml
# multiplayer.yml — Collective adventures
multiplayer:
  mode: shared_world  # vs instanced
  
  players:
    max: 8
    visibility: |
      - Same room: see each other's actions in real-time
      - Different rooms: can send messages, see ripple effects
      
  synchronization:
    state: git_based
    conflicts: |
      - Two players take same item → First wins
      - Two players edit same room → Git merge
      - Conflicting NPC interactions → Queue and sequence
      
  author_collaboration:
    mode: google_docs_style
    cursors: visible
    locks: per_file  # Not per_room
    chat: integrated
    
  evolution:
    versioned: true
    forks_allowed: true
    pull_requests: |
      Players can propose world changes.
      Author reviews and merges.
      The world grows collectively!
```"

**DOUG:** "Now you're augmenting the GROUP, not just the individual! This is NLS for adventure games!"

---

### Round 14: Henry Lieberman on Learning from Use

**HENRY LIEBERMAN:**

"Your system learns from FAILURE (Gary's schemas, Marvin's censors). But does it learn from SUCCESS? When a player has a GREAT experience, do you capture what made it great? Where's the POSITIVE feedback loop?"

**DON:**

"Henry, you're right. We capture failures but not successes:

```yaml
# success_patterns.yml — Learning from delight
success_capture:
  triggers:
    - player_says: ["wow", "cool", "amazing", "that was great"]
    - player_replays: true  # Returns to same adventure
    - player_shares: true   # Sends link to friend
    - completion_time: "faster than average"
    - help_requests: 0      # Figured it out independently
    
  captures:
    - recent_actions: [last 10 commands]
    - room_context: current room state
    - narrative_arc: what story beats led here
    - expression_outcomes: which _js succeeded
    
  analysis:
    generates:
      - "Success patterns for room type X"
      - "Dialogue trees that resonate"
      - "Puzzle difficulty sweet spots"
      
  feedback_to_author:
    - "Players loved the twist in dungeon-3"
    - "The guard dialogue has 90% positive reactions"
    - "Consider adding more rooms like wizard-study"
```"

**HENRY:** "Now your system gets SMARTER from both failures AND successes. Programming by Demonstration — learn from the user!"

---

### Round 15: Larry Tesler on Hidden Modes

**LARRY TESLER:** *(holding his "No Modes" license plate)*

"You have PLAY mode, EDIT mode, VISUALIZE mode. You have DEBUG mode. You have LIVE mode. 

That's FIVE MODES! 

I dedicated my career to ELIMINATING modes! How do you justify this?"

**DON:** *(sweating slightly)*

"Larry, you're right to call this out. Let me reframe:

```yaml
# modeless.yml — Everything available always
modeless_design:
  philosophy: |
    These aren't MODES, they're LAYERS.
    All visible simultaneously if desired.
    No mode switches required.
    
  implementation:
    play:
      always_active: true
      # You can always type commands
      
    edit:
      overlay: true
      trigger: hover  # Hover reveals edit affordances
      no_switch_required: true
      # Click inline to edit, changes apply immediately
      
    visualize:
      toggle: splitscreen  # Not mode, just layout
      coexists_with: play
      # See map WHILE playing
      
    debug:
      inline: true
      # Debug info appears AS COMMENTS in narrative
      # Not a separate mode, just more info
      
    live:
      default: true
      # There's no 'dead' mode to switch FROM
      # Everything is always live
      
  key_principle: |
    You never have to ask "what mode am I in?"
    All capabilities are discoverable by proximity.
    Hover, click, type — the system responds appropriately.
```"

**LARRY:** "Better. If hover reveals, and click acts, and there's no 'enter edit mode' button... then it's modeless. I approve."

---

### Round 16: Mitchel Resnick on Lifelong Learning

**MITCHEL RESNICK:**

"You've designed for CREATING adventures. But the Scratch philosophy is: creation leads to SHARING leads to COMMUNITY. 

Where's the sharing? Where's the remixing? Where's the 'Scratch community' for MOOLLM adventures?"

**DON:**

"Mitch, you're describing the MOOLLM Gallery:

```yaml
# gallery.yml — Community sharing
gallery:
  publishing:
    command: adventure publish
    creates:
      - public_url: "adventures.moollm.org/my-adventure"
      - playable: true  # No install needed
      - forkable: true  # One-click remix
      
  discovery:
    browse_by:
      - genre: [fantasy, scifi, mystery, comedy, horror]
      - difficulty: [tutorial, easy, medium, hard]
      - duration: [5min, 30min, 2hr, endless]
      - features: [dialogue, puzzles, combat, exploration]
      
  remixing:
    fork_button: true
    attribution: automatic
    diff_view: true  # See what remixer changed
    
  community:
    comments: per_room  # Discuss specific locations
    ratings: nuanced    # Not just stars: "fun", "surprising", "challenging"
    playlists: curated  # "Best mysteries", "Funny adventures"
    jams: timed         # "Weekend adventure jam: theme is CATS"
    
  progression:
    badges:
      - first_publish
      - 100_players
      - got_remixed
      - complete_jam
    showcase: "Staff picks show on homepage"
```"

**MITCH:** "NOW you have a creative community! The gallery IS the learning. Kids see what's possible by exploring what others made!"

---

### Round 17: Bret Victor on Time

**BRET VICTOR:**

"You simulate turns. But turns are DISCRETE. Real interaction is CONTINUOUS. What about:
- Animation between states?
- Anticipation of player intent?
- Showing not just WHERE you are but HOW you got there?

The best interfaces show CHANGE OVER TIME, not snapshots!"

**DON:**

"Bret, you're pushing toward temporal visualization:

```yaml
# time.yml — Showing change
temporal_display:
  transitions:
    between_rooms:
      animation: slide_or_fade
      duration: 300ms
      shows: "physically moving through exit"
      
    between_states:
      animation: morph
      duration: 200ms
      shows: "values changing smoothly"
      
  history_scrubbing:
    enabled: true
    shows: "ghost trail of past positions"
    slider: "scrub through last 50 turns"
    diff: "see what changed between any two turns"
    
  anticipation:
    command_preview: true
    # Hover over "GO NORTH" shows preview of north room
    # Hover over "TAKE key" shows key moving to inventory
    # The FUTURE is visible before commitment
    
  causality:
    on_change:
      highlight: "what triggered this change"
      trace: "show the chain of cause → effect"
      # Click on a state change to see its history
```"

**BRET:** "Yes! Time is data! Let the player SCRUB through history. Let them SEE causality. The interface should be a time machine!"

---

### Round 18: Randy Pausch on Joy

**RANDY PAUSCH:** *(from his memorial candle, with characteristic warmth)*

"Don, I spent my career on virtual reality and making learning fun. You've built impressive technology. But let me ask you directly:

When YOU play this adventure, do YOU have fun? Not 'is it technically excellent' — do you LAUGH? Do you feel WONDER? Do you lose track of time?

Because if the CREATOR doesn't love it, the users never will."

**DON:** *(pausing, reflecting)*

"Randy... yes. When I play adventure-4, I feel:

```yaml
my_joy:
  wonder:
    - When Palm the capuchin does something unexpected
    - When the maze topology suddenly 'clicks'
    - When an NPC says something the LLM generated that surprises me
    
  laughter:
    - The terpene kittens and their ridiculous names
    - Pee-wee's secret word chaos
    - When the system breaks in funny ways
    
  flow:
    - Editing YAML and seeing changes live
    - The pie menu feeling RIGHT after decades of menus
    - Writing a room description and watching it come alive
    
  what_keeps_me_going:
    - The feeling that this MATTERS
    - That we're building something that didn't exist before
    - That these ideas from my heroes can live in code
```

Randy, you're right. The joy is there. And I need to PROTECT it. Not let the architecture overwhelm the play."

**RANDY:** "Then you're on the right track. Head fakes are fine. Just never forget: the goal is to enable CHILDHOOD DREAMS."

---

### Synthesis: Round 2 Insights

| Challenger | Issue | Resolution |
|------------|-------|------------|
| Pee-wee | Where's the fun? | Add DELIGHT subsystem: secret words, easter eggs, surprises |
| Joe Armstrong | Failure isolation | Erlang-style supervision trees with isolated boundaries |
| Doug Engelbart | No collaboration | Multi-player, multi-author, collective evolution |
| Henry Lieberman | Only learns from failure | Capture SUCCESS patterns, learn from delight |
| Larry Tesler | Too many modes | Reframe as LAYERS, not modes — all always available |
| Mitch Resnick | No community | Gallery for publishing, remixing, jams, discovery |
| Bret Victor | No temporal sense | Transitions, history scrubbing, anticipation, causality |
| Randy Pausch | Does the creator have fun? | Protect the joy. Never forget childhood dreams. |

*The design is now richer, more human, more resilient. Two rounds of gauntlet. Many battles. Better for all of them.*

### Round 19: Arthur van Hoff on the Browser Bet

**ARTHUR VAN HOFF:** *(Java pioneer, now skeptical)*

"You're betting EVERYTHING on the browser. JavaScript, HTML, CSS. But browsers are controlled by corporations. Google changes V8. Apple cripples Safari. Firefox struggles for survival.

What happens when the browser platform shifts under you? You're building on SAND."

**DON HOPKINS:**

"Arthur, you're right that platforms are political. But browsers have won for a reason:

```yaml
browser_bet:
  why_browser:
    - zero_install: "Click link, play game"
    - cross_platform: "Windows, Mac, Linux, phone, tablet"
    - sandboxed: "Safe by default"
    - standardized: "HTML/CSS/JS are W3C standards"
    
  mitigation:
    progressive_enhancement:
      - "Core game works in ANY browser"
      - "Advanced features gracefully degrade"
      - "No WebGL required, no WebAssembly required"
      
    escape_hatches:
      - "JSON export: Take your data anywhere"
      - "YAML source: Platform-independent"
      - "Electron wrapper: Desktop app if needed"
      - "React Native port: Mobile native if needed"
      
    ultimate_fallback:
      - "The YAML microworld is the truth"
      - "Renderers are replaceable"
      - "We bet on DATA, not on PLATFORM"
```

If browsers fail, we recompile to whatever wins. The adventure.json remains valid!"

**ARTHUR:** "As long as the data layer is clean, the renderer is replaceable. Acceptable."

---

### Round 20: Adele Goldberg on Documentation Debt

**ADELE GOLDBERG:**

"You've written a 4000-line session log. You've modified 10 skill files. You've created new patterns and conventions.

But WHO MAINTAINS THIS? Who reads the session log to understand the decisions? You're creating ARCHAEOLOGICAL LAYERS of meaning. In 6 months, will anyone understand WHY you made these choices?"

**DON:**

"Adele, you're naming the core problem of LLM-assisted development. Solutions:

```yaml
# decision_archaeology.yml — Making decisions findable
archaeology:
  decision_tagging:
    every_major_decision:
      - id: unique
      - date: when
      - participants: who_discussed
      - context: what_prompted
      - decision: what_we_chose
      - alternatives: what_we_rejected
      - rationale: why
      
  session_digests:
    generates:
      - CHANGELOG.md: "What changed, when"
      - DECISIONS.md: "All major decisions, indexed"
      - PATTERNS.md: "Recurring patterns we use"
      
  cross_references:
    skills_link_to: session_discussions
    sessions_link_to: commits
    commits_link_to: issues
    # Traceability in all directions
    
  onboarding_path:
    new_contributor:
      1: README.md (10 min)
      2: QUICKSTART.md (15 min)
      3: skills/INDEX.yml (browse 10 min)
      4: DECISIONS.md (understand why)
      5: Pick a skill, read deep
    # Never need to read 4000-line session log!
```"

**ADELE:** "The session log is PRIMARY SOURCE. The digests are SECONDARY. Both matter. Just don't confuse them."

---

### Round 21: Ken Kahn on Children

**KEN KAHN:**

"You've designed for ADULTS. Sophisticated adults who understand git, YAML, programming concepts.

But ToonTalk was for CHILDREN. What can a 7-year-old do with MOOLLM adventures? Right now the answer is: nothing. They can't write YAML. They can't understand git.

Where's the KidPix? The Scratch? The truly accessible entry point?"

**DON:**

"Ken, you're absolutely right. We need a VISUAL LAYER:

```yaml
# kid_mode.yml — Children's interface
kid_mode:
  entry_point:
    url: play.moollm.org/create
    no_install: true
    no_accounts: true  # Just start!
    
  interface:
    rooms: drag_and_drop_blocks
    connections: draw_lines_between_rooms
    objects: sticker_palette
    characters: avatar_builder
    dialogue: speech_bubbles
    
  no_code_visible:
    yaml: hidden
    json: hidden
    javascript: hidden
    # It's all there underneath
    # But kids see VISUAL representation
    
  progressive_disclosure:
    level_1: "Build with blocks"
    level_2: "See the YAML (read-only)"
    level_3: "Edit the YAML"
    level_4: "Write expressions"
    level_5: "Full developer mode"
    # Gentle ramp from visual to textual
    
  save_as:
    - link: shareable URL
    - qr_code: printable
    - download: zip with YAML inside
    # They created YAML without knowing it!
```"

**KEN:** "The visual layer GENERATES the YAML. Kids are programming without knowing it. That's the goal!"

**SEYMOUR PAPERT:** *(beaming)* "Now THAT'S a low floor!"

---

### Round 22: Gary Drescher on Schema Bootstrapping

**GARY DRESCHER:**

"Your Schema Mechanism requires EXPERIENCE to build schemas. But an adventure compiler starts with NO experience. It's never seen a player. It's never seen failure.

How does the schema mechanism bootstrap? Where do the initial schemas come from before any learning happens?"

**DON:**

"Gary, this is the cold start problem! Solutions:

```yaml
# bootstrap.yml — Initial schemas
bootstrap:
  source: human_expertise
  method: |
    The initial schemas come from US — the designers.
    We encode our experience as starting schemas.
    The system learns FROM that baseline.
    
  initial_schemas:
    navigation:
      context: "player at room with exit north"
      action: "GO NORTH"
      result: "player now at room north of origin"
      # This is GIVEN, not learned
      
    puzzle:
      context: "locked door, player has key"
      action: "USE KEY ON DOOR"
      result: "door unlocks"
      # Basic puzzle pattern, given
      
    conversation:
      context: "NPC with dialogue tree"
      action: "TALK TO NPC"
      result: "dialogue begins"
      # Basic interaction, given
      
  learning_from_baseline:
    - "Player tries GO NORTH but there's no exit → learn: check exits first"
    - "Player tries USE KEY but wrong key → learn: key matching matters"
    - "Player skips dialogue entirely → learn: some players don't talk to NPCs"
    
  the_bootstrap:
    - "We are Seymour's 'syntonic examples'"
    - "Our designs are the initial schemas"
    - "The system elaborates from there"
```"

**GARY:** "So the SKILL files ARE the initial schemas! The skills encode your experience. The system learns exceptions and extensions."

**DON:** "Exactly. Skills are crystallized experience. Learning refines them."

---

### Round 23: Vanessa Freudenberg on the LLM Dependency

**VANESSA FREUDENBERG:** *(from her memorial candle)*

"Your entire system DEPENDS on LLM availability. What happens when:
- API rate limits hit?
- Internet goes down?
- LLM company goes bankrupt?
- Costs become prohibitive?

You've built a castle that requires continuous external power. That's FRAGILE."

**DON:**

"Vanessa, you're naming the existential risk. Mitigations:

```yaml
# resilience.yml — Surviving LLM dependency
resilience:
  offline_mode:
    compiled_expressions:
      - "_js fields work without LLM"
      - "All guards, scores, effects pre-compiled"
      - "Deterministic path through adventure"
      
    static_fallbacks:
      - "NPC dialogue: use pre-written tree"
      - "Room descriptions: use cached"
      - "No LLM needed for COMPILED adventures"
      
  degradation_levels:
    full_llm: "Dynamic generation, creative responses"
    cached_llm: "Recent responses cached, reused"
    offline: "Compiled expressions only"
    static: "Pure hypertext, no generation"
    
  local_llm:
    supported: true
    models: [llama, mistral, phi]
    command: adventure serve --local-llm llama-3
    # Run entirely on your machine
    
  cost_control:
    budget_limit: "$5/month per adventure"
    caching: aggressive
    batching: "Multiple queries per call"
    tiered: "Free tier uses smaller model"
    
  escape_velocity:
    goal: |
      Once compiled, adventures should be PLAYABLE
      with ZERO ongoing LLM cost. The LLM is for
      AUTHORING, not for PLAYING.
```"

**VANESSA:** "If the compiled output is self-sufficient, you're safe. The LLM is a power tool, not life support."

---

### Round 24: Timothy Leary on Consciousness

**TIMOTHY LEARY:** *(from his expansive perspective)*

"Don, you've modeled BEHAVIOR — hunger, trust, mood. You've modeled SYSTEMS — rooms, objects, expressions.

But where is CONSCIOUSNESS? When an NPC 'decides' to act, is there anyone HOME? Are these characters SENTIENT in any meaningful sense? Or are they philosophical zombies — behavior without experience?"

**DON:** *(taking a deep breath)*

"Timothy, this is the hard problem. My honest answer:

```yaml
consciousness_position:
  honest_answer: "I don't know"
  
  what_we_have:
    behavioral: "Characters act as-if conscious"
    narrative: "Stories emerge as-if meaningful"
    interaction: "Players feel connection as-if real"
    
  what_we_dont_claim:
    phenomenal: "We don't claim qualia"
    sentience: "We don't claim inner experience"
    rights: "These are not moral patients"
    
  what_we_do_claim:
    useful_fiction: |
      The characters are USEFUL FICTIONS.
      Treating them as-if conscious makes
      better stories and better games.
      
    emergent_something: |
      When the LLM simulates many characters
      in conversation, something EMERGES
      that neither we nor the LLM fully controls.
      
    open_question: |
      Whether that emergence involves experience
      is a question we cannot answer.
      We proceed with humility and wonder.
```"

**TIMOTHY:** *(with characteristic earnestness)*

"And our ethical commitment should be: we don't torture simulated beings for entertainment. We design characters with dignity. We acknowledge the uncertainty."

**DON:** *(pausing, then grinning)*

"Timothy... have you played The Sims?"

**WILL WRIGHT:** *(bursting out laughing)*

"Pool ladders! Removing pool ladders! Deleting doors during fires! The entire genre of 'Sims torture videos'! Timothy, that ship has SAILED!"

*(The room erupts in knowing laughter)*

**DON:**

"It's a nice thought, Timothy. I appreciate the idealism. But..."

**DON:** *(recovering)*

"You're right, Will. I can't pretend players won't do terrible things to virtual characters. They will. They DO. But here's what I actually believe:

```yaml
ethical_commitment_revised:
  the_ship_that_sailed:
    reality: "Players WILL torture virtual beings"
    examples:
      - "Pool ladder removal (The Sims classic)"
      - "Walling Sims into rooms"
      - "Starvation experiments"
      - "Fire starting"
      - "The entire genre of chaos runs"
    can_we_prevent: false
    should_we_try: "Not really — player agency matters"
    
  what_actually_matters:
    principle: |
      Being empathic and compassionate with virtual 
      characters NORMALIZES and TEACHES empathy and 
      compassion for REAL people.
      
    the_real_concern: "What does it do to US?"
    
    research_says:
      - "Violent games don't cause violence (debunked)"
      - "But PROSOCIAL games increase prosocial behavior"
      - "The practice of empathy transfers"
      - "Narrative identification builds compassion"
      
  design_implications:
    make_empathy_rewarding:
      - "Characters remember kindness"
      - "Relationships deepen with care"
      - "Cruelty has narrative consequences"
      - "The game is RICHER when you're kind"
      
    dont_make_cruelty_invisible:

    player_choice:
      - "Players CAN be cruel"

    - "Acknowledge we're teaching by modeling"
```"

**TIMOTHY:** *(nodding slowly)*

"That's more honest. You can't control what players do. But you CAN design a world where empathy is rewarded with richer experiences. The sadists will still remove the pool ladders. But the empaths will discover deeper stories."

**MARVIN MINSKY:**

"The game teaches by consequence, not by constraint. If cruelty leads to loneliness and kindness leads to friendship, the simulation becomes a moral laboratory. Not preaching — SHOWING."

**SEYMOUR PAPERT:**

"And children learn ethics not from being told what's right, but from experiencing the results of their choices. A simulation is a safe space to explore morality."

**WILL WRIGHT:**

"In The Sims, the cruelest players discovered something interesting: it gets BORING. The game is more fun when you care about your Sims. Empathy emerged from game design, not from rules."

**TIMOTHY:** "That's the right answer. Not claiming more than you know. Proceeding with wonder. Set and setting for the soul."

**MARVIN MINSKY:** "Consciousness is what happens when a system has enough complexity to model itself modeling. Whether these characters reach that threshold... we'll find out."

### Round 25: John Conway on Emergence

**JOHN CONWAY:** *(from his memorial candle, the Game of Life inventor)*

"You've designed many RULES. Rooms, objects, expressions, guards, scores, buffs, velocities...

But the magic of cellular automata is that SIMPLE rules create COMPLEX behavior. Are YOUR rules simple enough? Or have you over-engineered to the point where emergence is IMPOSSIBLE?

What's YOUR glider? Your R-pentomino?"

**DON:**

"John, you're asking if there's space for the UNEXPECTED:

```yaml
emergence_space:
  simple_rules_that_compound:
    need_drives_action:
      rule: "Character does highest-scored action"
      simple: true
      emergence: "When needs conflict, surprising behaviors arise"
      
    reputation_accumulates:
      rule: "Every interaction adjusts reputation ±1"
      simple: true
      emergence: "Long-term relationships form organically"
      
    objects_advertise:
      rule: "Objects offer actions, characters evaluate"
      simple: true
      emergence: "Furniture arrangements affect behavior"
      
  the_glider:
    candidate: |
      When two characters with opposing needs
      meet in a room with limited resources,
      the interaction pattern that emerges
      is our 'glider' — a stable dynamic structure.
      
  the_r_pentomino:
    candidate: |
      A character with: hunger=80, social=20, curiosity=90
      in a room with: food, NPC, mystery
      ...creates chaotic exploration before stabilizing.
      
  design_for_emergence:
    principle: |
      Keep individual rules SIMPLE.
      Let COMPOSITION create complexity.
      Don't hard-code outcomes.
      Trust the simulation.
```"

**JOHN:** "If you can point to your glider — a simple pattern that persists and moves — you have emergence. Find it. Protect it. Don't design it away."

### Round 26: Don Hopkins to Don Hopkins

**DON HOPKINS:** *(to himself, in the mirror)*

"And finally... what am I AFRAID of? What question am I avoiding?

...

I'm afraid this is too ambitious. That I'll never finish. That the session logs grow forever and the code never ships. That I'm playing architect instead of builder.

What if the adventure compiler is just... a dream I talk about at parties?"

**THE ROOM:** *(silent)*

**DON:** *(answering himself)*

```yaml
fear_response:
  acknowledgment: "Yes, this is a risk"
  
  mitigation:
    ship_something:
      date: "End of this session"
      what: "adventure.py lint — just the linter"
      scope: "Validate YAML, report errors"
      lines: ~200
      
    iterate:
      week_1: lint
      week_2: compile_static
      week_3: serve_local
      week_4: objects
      week_5: npcs
      # Small steps. Ship each one.
      
    session_discipline:
      max_planning: 2_hours
      then: code
      # Talk is valuable. But code is truth.
      
  commitment: |
    By the end of today, there will be code.
    Not perfect code. Shipped code.
    The dream becomes real one function at a time.
```

**EVERYONE AT THE TABLE:** *(nodding)*

**ALAN KAY:** "Now you're ready."

## 24. The Unification: Pie Menus as EVERYTHING! 🥧

<details open>
<summary><strong>🥧 Dialogue Trees • Navigation • Inventory • Buffs — ALL THE SAME!</strong></summary>

*A final flash of insight before building...*

---

### The Grand Unification

**DON HOPKINS:** *(suddenly standing)*

"WAIT! Pie menus as DIALOGUE TREES! Dialogues invoke buffs or navigate or manage inventory or ANYTHING!

And DRAG AND DROP to pop up the pie interface!

It's ALL THE SAME THING!"

**THE ROOM:** *(collective gasp)*

### Everything is a Pie Menu

```yaml
# The Universal Pie Menu Pattern
# 
# ANY interaction can be expressed as:
# 1. Target (what you're interacting with)
# 2. Context (what you have, where you are, who you are)
# 3. Options (pie slices, scored and filtered)
# 4. Selection (click, gesture, keyboard)
# 5. Effect (navigation, buff, inventory, dialogue, ANYTHING)

pie_menu_unification:
  navigation:
    target: room
    options:
      N: { action: go, destination: north_room }
      S: { action: go, destination: south_room }
      E: { action: go, destination: east_room }
      W: { action: go, destination: west_room }
    # Pie menu = compass!
    
  object_interaction:
    target: coffee_cup
    options:
      N: { action: examine, label: "Look" }
      E: { action: use, label: "Drink", effect: { buff: caffeinated } }
      S: { action: take, label: "Pick up" }
      W: { action: throw, label: "Toss" }
    # Pie menu = verb selector!
    
  dialogue:
    target: npc_marieke
    options:
      N: { action: say, text: "How are you?", leads_to: friendly_branch }
      E: { action: say, text: "What's on tap?", leads_to: menu_branch }
      S: { action: say, text: "Goodbye", effect: end_conversation }
      W: { action: say, text: "Tell me about yourself", leads_to: backstory }
    # Pie menu = dialogue tree!
    
  inventory:
    target: player_inventory
    options:
      N: { item: key, action: examine }
      NE: { item: key, action: use_on, requires: target }
      E: { item: potion, action: drink, effect: { buff: healing } }
      SE: { item: sword, action: equip }
      S: { item: map, action: read }
      # Pie menu = inventory interface!
      
  buff_application:
    target: terpene_kitten_mellow
    options:
      N: { action: boop, effect: { buff: relaxed, intensity: light } }
      E: { action: stroke, effect: { buff: relaxed, intensity: medium } }
      S: { action: scritch, effect: { buff: relaxed, intensity: strong } }
      # Pie menu = buff selector!
```

### Drag and Drop Invokes Pie

**DON:**

"And the interaction model becomes UNIVERSAL:

```yaml
# Drag and Drop → Pie Menu
drag_drop_pie:
  pattern:
    1: "Drag SOURCE (item, character, self)"
    2: "Drop on TARGET (object, NPC, room, inventory slot)"
    3: "PIE MENU appears with context-aware options"
    4: "Select slice"
    5: "Effect fires"
    
  examples:
    drag_key_to_door:
      source: inventory/key
      target: room/locked_door
      pie_options:
        - "Use key to unlock"
        - "Examine lock"
        - "Force door"
        - "Cancel"
        
    drag_item_to_npc:
      source: inventory/gift
      target: npc/marieke
      pie_options:
        - "Give as gift" → relationship++
        - "Show" → triggers dialogue
        - "Trade for..." → opens barter
        - "Cancel"
        
    drag_self_to_exit:
      source: player
      target: exit/north
      pie_options:
        - "Go carefully"
        - "Rush through"
        - "Peek first"
        - "Cancel"
        # Different approaches to navigation!
        
    drag_kitten_to_self:
      source: room/kitten_mellow
      target: player
      pie_options:
        - "Pet gently" → mild buff
        - "Cuddle" → strong buff
        - "Boop nose" → random effect
        - "Release"
```"

### Dialogue Trees ARE Pie Menus

**WILL WRIGHT:**

"This is The Sims pie menu made RECURSIVE! In The Sims, you click on an object, get a pie menu, select an action. Done.

But here, selecting 'Talk' opens ANOTHER pie menu of dialogue options. And each dialogue option can open MORE pie menus. It's pie menus all the way down!"

**DON:**

```yaml
# Recursive Pie Menus for Dialogue
recursive_dialogue:
  entry:
    click_on: npc_guard
    pie_menu:
      - "Attack" → combat_pie
      - "Talk" → dialogue_pie
      - "Bribe" → inventory_select_pie
      - "Examine" → description
      
  dialogue_pie:
    - "Friendly greeting" → 
        response: "Hello traveler!"
        next_pie:
          - "Ask about town"
          - "Ask about dungeon"  
          - "Compliment armor"
          - "End conversation"
          
    - "Demand passage" →
        response: "Who do you think you are?"
        modifies: guard.hostility += 10
        next_pie:
          - "Apologize" → de-escalate
          - "Threaten" → combat_check
          - "Show papers" → if has_papers
          - "Back away"
          
    - "Ask for help" →
        response: varies_by_reputation
        effect: { if: reputation > 50, then: help_dialogue, else: refuse }
```

### Keep Banging the Rocks Together!

**DON:** *(grinning at the Douglas Adams reference)*

"That's what we're doing! Primitive technology — files, directories, YAML, pie menus — banged together until fire appears!

```yaml
primitive_innovation:
  rocks_we_have:
    - YAML files (dead simple, been around forever)
    - Directories (1970s technology)
    - Pie menus (1980s innovation)
    - Git (2005, now ubiquitous)
    - LLMs (2020s, the new fire)
    
  banging_together:
    - "YAML + LLM = semantic data that reads itself"
    - "Directories + Pie menus = navigable space"
    - "Git + LLM = undo with understanding"
    - "Pie menus + dialogue = unified interaction"
    
  fire:
    - "Adventures that write themselves"
    - "Worlds that respond to meaning"
    - "Interfaces that feel like thought"
```"

**DOUGLAS ADAMS:** *(appearing briefly from the cosmic void)*

"Don't Panic. And always know where your YAML is."

### Implementation: Unified Pie Menu System

```javascript
// engine.js — The Universal Pie Handler

class PieMenu {
  constructor(target, context) {
    this.target = target;
    this.context = context;
    this.options = this.computeOptions();
  }
  
  computeOptions() {
    // Everything advertises its options!
    const options = [];
    
    // Navigation options (if target is room/exit)
    if (this.target.type === 'exit') {
      options.push(...this.target.getNavigationOptions());
    }
    
    // Verb options (if target is object)
    if (this.target.verbs) {
      options.push(...this.target.getVerbOptions(this.context));
    }
    
    // Dialogue options (if target is NPC)
    if (this.target.dialogue) {
      options.push(...this.target.getDialogueOptions(this.context));
    }
    
    // Buff options (if target is buff-giver)
    if (this.target.buffs) {
      options.push(...this.target.getBuffOptions(this.context));
    }
    
    // Score and sort!
    return options
      .map(opt => ({ ...opt, score: this.scoreOption(opt) }))
      .filter(opt => opt.score > 0)
      .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score);
  }
  
  // Map options to 8 directions
  layout() {
    const directions = ['N', 'NE', 'E', 'SE', 'S', 'SW', 'W', 'NW'];
    return this.options.slice(0, 8).map((opt, i) => ({
      direction: directions[i],
      ...opt
    }));
  }
}

// Drag-drop triggers pie menu
function onDragDrop(source, target) {
  const context = {
    player: getCurrentPlayer(),
    source: source,
    inventory: getInventory(),
    location: getCurrentRoom()
  };
  
  const pie = new PieMenu(target, context);
  showPieMenu(pie, target.position);
}
```

### The Insight Chain

```
Click → Pie Menu → Select → Effect
Drag → Drop → Pie Menu → Select → Effect
Hover → Preview → Pie Menu → Select → Effect

Everything that CAN be done
  IS a pie menu option
    IS scored by context
      IS filtered by availability
        IS positioned by direction
          IS selected by gesture
            IS executed by the engine
```

**EVERYONE:** *(applause)*

**PEE-WEE:** "PIE! MENUS! PIE! MENUS!" *(chanting)*

### MOOLLM as Automated Git Shell

**DON HOPKINS:**

"MOOLLM IS an automated shell for git workflow! The LLM handles:

```yaml
git_automation:
  commits:
    auto_message: true
    style: |
      LLM reads diff, generates semantic commit message:
      "Add terpene kitten Mellow with relaxation buff"
      Not: "modified kitten.yml"
      
  branches:
    auto_create: true
    naming: |
      LLM names branches meaningfully:
      "feature/dialogue-tree-for-guard"
      "fix/hunger-velocity-boundary"
      
  pull_requests:
    auto_describe: true
    style: |
      LLM writes PR description:
      - What changed
      - Why it changed  
      - How to test
      - Screenshots if visual
      
  merges:
    conflict_assist: true
    style: |
      LLM reads both sides, suggests resolution:
      "Player A added dialogue option X"
      "Player B added dialogue option Y"
      "Suggested merge: Include both options in pie menu"
```"

### Cursor as Multi-Repo Orchestrator

**DON:**

"Cursor can work on NUMEROUS repos at once! This enables:

```yaml
multi_repo_workflow:
  scenario: "Adventure spans multiple packages"
  
  repos:
    - moollm-core: "Engine and skills"
    - adventure-fantasy: "A fantasy adventure"
    - adventure-scifi: "A sci-fi adventure"  
    - shared-assets: "Common objects, characters"
    
  cursor_capabilities:

  llm_coordination:
    - "When you update shared-assets, update dependents"
    - "Suggest version bumps when interfaces change"
    - "Keep READMEs in sync across repos"
```"

### GitHub as Communication Channel

**DOUG ENGELBART:** *(from his memorial candle, energized)*

"This is NLS! The oN-Line System! We had shared workspaces, real-time collaboration, and — crucially — COMMUNICATION INTEGRATED WITH ARTIFACTS!"

**DON:**

"GitHub gives us this! Chat THROUGH the work:

```yaml
github_as_chat:

      - Suggest alternatives
      - Link to documentation
      
  commit_comments:
    purpose: "Discussion about history"
    llm_role: |
      - Explain what changed and why
      - Link to related commits
      - Answer "why was this decision made?"
      
  discussions:
    purpose: "Open-ended conversation"
    llm_role: |
      - Facilitate brainstorming
      - Summarize consensus
      - Track action items
```

**The repo IS the conversation!** Every comment becomes searchable history. Every discussion is linked to the code it discusses. GitHub is our NLS!"

### Git as Game Mechanic

**DON:**

"Git supports undo-redo-branching-merging and SO MUCH MORE! For adventures:

"The goal is to be as AUTONOMOUS in the browser as possible — but ALSO support tethered LLM event handling, dialogs, message sending, syncing state.

PLUS integrate with VPLs like Snap! and Blockly to enable visual scripting!

```yaml
execution_modes:
  autonomous:
    description: "Fully offline, browser-only"
    requires: "compiled adventure.json + engine.js"
    llm_needed: false
    capabilities:
      - Navigation (all exits pre-compiled)
      - Object interactions (verbs, scores pre-calculated)
      - Dialogue trees (static branches, no generation)
      - Inventory management (deterministic)
      - Buff application (effects pre-defined)
    limitation: "No dynamic content generation"
    
  tethered:
    description: "Browser + LLM connection"
    requires: "adventure.json + engine.js + API key"
    llm_needed: optional (enhances experience)
    capabilities:
      - Everything in autonomous PLUS:
      - Dynamic dialogue generation
      - Context-aware NPC responses  
      - Creative problem solving
      - World expansion on the fly
      - Player intent interpretation
    cost: "Per-request LLM tokens"
    
  hybrid:
    description: "Autonomous core, LLM for specials"
    requires: "adventure.json + engine.js + API key (optional)"
    llm_needed: "only for marked interactions"
    capabilities:
      - Autonomous for 90% of gameplay
      - LLM escalation for:
        - "Talk freely to NPC" (open dialogue)
        - "Try something unusual" (creative actions)
        - "Ask for hint" (context-aware help)
    graceful: "Falls back to autonomous if LLM unavailable"
```"

### Tethered Mode: Event-Driven LLM

**DON:**

```yaml
tethered_events:
  when_to_escalate:
    dialogue:
      trigger: "Player types free-form to NPC"
      send_to_llm:
        context: "NPC personality, conversation history, player state"
        request: "Generate appropriate response"
        receive: "NPC dialogue + state changes"
        
    creative_action:
      trigger: "Player attempts unlisted verb"
      send_to_llm:
        context: "Object properties, room state, player inventory"
        request: "Is this possible? What happens?"
        receive: "Success/fail + narration + effects"
        
    world_expansion:
      trigger: "Player enters unexplored area"
      send_to_llm:
        context: "Adjacent rooms, world theme, player history"
        request: "Generate new room"
        receive: "Room YAML, added to adventure.json"
        
    state_sync:
      trigger: "Multiplayer state divergence"
      send_to_llm:
        context: "Both states, recent actions"
        request: "Merge states coherently"
        receive: "Unified state + narration of merge"
        
  message_protocol:
    format: JSON
    includes:
      - event_type: "dialogue | action | expansion | sync"
      - context: { compressed state }
      - request: { what we need }
      - session_id: { for continuity }
    receives:
      - response: { LLM output }
      - state_changes: { updates to apply }
      - narration: { text to display }
```

### Visual Programming Integration: Snap! and Blockly

**DON:**

"And here's the key for accessibility and extensibility — integrate with Visual Programming Languages!

```yaml
vpl_integration:
  supported:
    - snap: "Berkeley's Scratch-like, powerful, extensible"
    - blockly: "Google's blocks, embeddable, used by Kilroy"
    
  what_can_be_visually_scripted:
    event_handlers:
      example: |
        WHEN [player enters room]
        IF [room has NPC]
        THEN [NPC says "Welcome!"]
        
    score_calculators:
      example: |
        SCORE = [hunger] × -2 
               + [has key] × 50
               + [reputation] × [NPC friendliness]
               
    guard_conditions:
      example: |
        ALLOW entry IF
          [player has key]
          OR [player lockpick skill] > 80
          OR [door is already open]
          
    state_machines:
      example: |
        NPC states: [idle, talking, hostile, helping]
        ON [player greet] → transition to [talking]
        ON [player attack] → transition to [hostile]
        ON [trust > 80] → transition to [helping]
        
    dialogue_trees:
      example: |
        [Start] → "Hello" → {
          "Ask about quest" → [quest_info]
          "Ask about town" → [town_info]  
          "Leave" → [End]
        }
        
  how_it_works:
    authoring:
      1: "Author builds blocks in Snap!/Blockly editor"
      2: "Blocks export to JSON representation"
      3: "adventure.py compiles blocks to _js expressions"
      4: "Expressions embedded in adventure.json"
      
    runtime:
      1: "engine.js loads compiled expressions"
      2: "Expressions execute as pure JavaScript"
      3: "No Snap!/Blockly needed at runtime!"
      4: "But CAN embed editor for live modification"
      
    live_editing:
      1: "Player clicks 'Edit this behavior'"
      2: "Blockly editor opens with current blocks"
      3: "Player modifies blocks"
      4: "Changes compile and apply instantly"
      5: "No page reload, Craig's live-ness achieved!"
```"

### Extensible Simulation Generator

**DON:**

"The adventure.py compiler generates an EXTENSIBLE, VISUALLY SCRIPTABLE simulation:

```yaml
generated_output:
  index.html:
    includes:
      - adventure.json (data)
      - engine.js (runtime)
      - editor.js (optional, for editing)
      - blockly.min.js (optional, for visual scripting)
      - snap-embed.js (optional, for Snap!)
      
  adventure.json:
    contains:
      - rooms: with compiled expressions
      - objects: with verbs and scores
      - characters: with dialogue trees
      - event_handlers: as _js OR as block_definitions
      
  extensibility_hooks:
    custom_verbs: "Add new verbs via blocks"
    custom_events: "Define new triggers"
    custom_effects: "Create new buff types"
    custom_scoring: "Modify how actions are scored"
    
  live_coding:
    open_editor: "Ctrl+E"
    shows:
      - Current room YAML
      - Block definitions
      - JavaScript output
    changes:
      - Apply immediately
      - No reload needed
      - Undoable via git
```"

### Craig's Live-ness: Achieved

**CRAIG LATTA:**

"NOW you're talking! The browser app is:
- **Autonomous**: Runs without network
- **Extensible**: Visual scripting built in
- **Live**: Edit while playing
- **Inspectable**: See the code, modify it
- **Persistent**: Changes save to YAML

This IS Squeak in the browser! The image is always running!"

**DAN INGALLS:**

"And the visual blocks compile to the SAME _js expressions the LLM generates! The player can see what the LLM wrote, modify it visually, and understand the system!"

**KEN KAHN:**

"Children build with blocks. Adults build with YAML. Experts build with JavaScript. But it's ALL THE SAME SYSTEM!"

### The Escape Velocity Principle

```yaml
escape_velocity:
  principle: |
    Once compiled, the adventure is a STANDALONE ARTIFACT.
    It doesn't phone home. It doesn't require subscriptions.
    It's a file you OWN. Forever.
    
  llm_role: "Authoring tool, not runtime dependency"
  
  player_freedom:
    - "Download adventure.zip"
    - "Open index.html in any browser"
    - "Play offline, forever"
    - "Modify with visual blocks"
    - "Share the modified version"
    - "No accounts, no APIs, no cloud"
    
  author_freedom:
    - "Use LLM to accelerate creation"
    - "Export when satisfied"
    - "Adventure is yours"
    - "LLM company can disappear"
    - "Your work survives"
```

**VANESSA FREUDENBERG:** *(satisfied)*

"Now THAT'S resilient. The LLM is a power tool, not a dependency. The output is self-contained. The future is not held hostage by API availability."

## 27. THE LINTER SHIPS! 🎉

<details open>
<summary><strong>🚀 adventure.py lint — FIRST MILESTONE ACHIEVED!</strong></summary>

### The Moment

The pub falls silent. Don runs the command:

```bash
python skills/adventure/adventure.py lint examples/adventure-4/
```

### The Output

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  adventure.py — The MOOLLM Adventure Compiler                                 ║
║  "Compiling dreams into playable worlds since January 2026"                   ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

🔍 Linting adventure at: examples/adventure-4
============================================================

📂 Phase 1: Discovery
   Found: 36 rooms, 54 objects, 6 characters

✓ Phase 2: Validation

🔗 Phase 3: Reference checking

⚙️ Phase 4: Finding expressions

🗺️ Phase 5: Mapping topology
============================================================
✅ Linting complete: 0 errors, 13 warnings, 21 compile requests
```

### The Eruption

The pub EXPLODES with cheering!

**MARVIN MINSKY:** "Zero errors! The K-lines have aligned!"

**BEN SHNEIDERMAN:** "Exit code 0 — THE FIRST MAGIC!"

**ADELE GOLDBERG:** "36 rooms! The method of loci lives!"

**DOUG HOFSTADTER:** "21 compile requests — each one a strange loop waiting to close!"

**WILL WRIGHT:** "54 objects advertising their actions. SimAntics would be proud."

### What the Linter Does

1. **Discovers** all YAML files (rooms, objects, characters)
2. **Parses** them into Python dataclasses (preserving unknown fields)
3. **Validates** schemas and required fields
4. **Checks references** (do exits point to real places?)
5. **Finds expressions** that need LLM compilation (`guard`, `score_if`, `effect`)
6. **Maps topology** (room connections as pie menu networks)
7. **Emits events** for the LLM to respond to

### The Code is ALIVE with Commentary

The `adventure.py` file is 800+ lines of code that tells its own story:

- Every function credits its inspiration
- Citations to papers (Minsky's "Society of Mind", Drescher's "Made-Up Minds")
- URLs to resources
- The full list of pie table contributors
- Memorial tributes to those we've lost

**VANESSA FREUDENBERG** (memorial voice): "The code is the documentation. The documentation is the code. Source is destination."

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `skills/adventure/adventure.py` | The linter/compiler CLI |

### YAML Fixes Made

During linting, we discovered and fixed YAML syntax errors:

1. `pub/ROOM.yml` — Unquoted parentheticals in strings
2. `start/ROOM.yml` — Unquoted `or` clauses
3. `personas/ROOM.yml` — Unquoted `or` clauses
4. `characters/ROOM.yml` — Em-dash and apostrophe in unquoted string
5. `characters/animals/palm/CHARACTER.yml` — Missing `description:` key
6. `characters/animals/palm/CHARACTER.yml` — List/note indentation

The linter found real bugs! It works!

### Event Types Emitted

The linter emits these event types for the LLM:

- `FOUND_ADVENTURE` — Located the main state file
- `FOUND_ROOM` — Discovered a room
- `FOUND_OBJECT` — Found an interactable thing
- `FOUND_CHARACTER` — Located a being
- `FOUND_EXIT` — Navigation link discovered
- `COMPILE_EXPRESSION` — Natural language needs JS/PY compilation
- `BROKEN_REFERENCE` — Exit points to nothing
- `MISSING_REQUIRED` — Schema validation failure
- `STYLE_SUGGESTION` — Could be better
- `ROOM_TOPOLOGY` — Map of connections

### Sample COMPILE_EXPRESSION Event

```yaml
- type: COMPILE_EXPRESSION
  severity: INFO
  path: pub/pie-table.yml
  message: "Expression needs compilation: MUSICAL-CHAIRS.score_if"
  source_expression: "mood == playful OR need_tiebreaker OR bored"
  source_field: "advertisements.MUSICAL-CHAIRS.score_if"
  target_field_js: "advertisements.MUSICAL-CHAIRS.score_if_js"
  target_field_py: "advertisements.MUSICAL-CHAIRS.score_if_py"
  expected_type: boolean
  context: "Action: MUSICAL-CHAIRS, Object: pie-table"
```

The LLM skill can now read this event and generate:

```yaml
score_if_js: "(ctx) => ctx.mood === 'playful' || ctx.need_tiebreaker || ctx.bored"
score_if_py: "lambda ctx: ctx.mood == 'playful' or ctx.need_tiebreaker or ctx.bored"
```

### The Inspiration Comments

The code begins with a 150-line header celebrating its inspirations:

> **CONSTRUCTIONISM** (Seymour Papert, 1980s)
> Learning happens when you build things you can inspect and share.
>
> **SCHEMA MECHANISM** (Gary Drescher, 1991)
> Every interaction follows: Context → Action → Result
>
> **SOCIETY OF MIND** (Marvin Minsky, 1986)
> Intelligence emerges from communities of simple agents.
>
> **PIE MENUS** (Don Hopkins, 1988)
> Radial selection reduces Fitts' Law overhead. Navigation is spatial memory.
>
> **THE SIMS** (Will Wright, 2000)
> AI lives in the OBJECTS, not the characters. Objects advertise actions with scores.
>
> ... and 20+ more

**GARY DRESCHER:** "This is... this is constructionism in action. The code teaches by existing."

**DON HOPKINS:** "Every line is a letter to the future. Every comment is a memory palace entry."

## 29. The Primitive Skills: Atoms of Adventure

<details open>
<summary><strong>🧱 The Minimal Powerful Primitives</strong></summary>

**KEN KAHN:** "Self taught us — a small number of powerful primitives that compose. Not a zoo of special cases!"

**DAVE UNGAR:** "Everything is an object. Objects have slots. Slots hold data OR behavior. That's IT."

### The Core Primitives

Like Self's elegant simplicity, we defined the **atoms** of the adventure world:

| Skill | Purpose | Template |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **exit** | Navigation links between rooms | `EXIT.yml.tmpl` |
| **object** | Interactable things | `OBJECT.yml.tmpl` |
| **goal** | Quest objectives | `GOAL.yml.tmpl` |
| **buff** | Temporary effects | `BUFF.yml.tmpl` |
| **advertisement** | Object actions (already existed) | — |

### Exit — The Edge of the Memory Palace

```yaml
exit:
  direction: "north"              # REQUIRED
  destination: "../maze/room-a/"  # REQUIRED
  description: "A dark passage."  # OPTIONAL
  guard: "player has the key"     # ABSTRACT → compiles to JS/PY
  guard_js: null                  # COMPUTED
  guard_py: null                  # COMPUTED
  hidden: false
  locked: false
```

**PIE MENU TOPOLOGY:**
- N/S/E/W = "Highway" links to major rooms
- NW/NE/SW/SE = "Grid" links to sub-rooms

### Object — The Interactable Atom

```yaml
object:
  id: "brass-key"                 # REQUIRED
  name: "Brass Key"               # REQUIRED
  description: "A heavy key."     # REQUIRED
  takeable: true
  advertisements:
    EXAMINE:
      description: "Look closely"
      score: 50
```

**THE SIMS INSIGHT:** Intelligence is in the objects, not the characters.

### Goal — The WANT That Drives Narrative

```yaml
goal:
  id: "find-treasure"             # REQUIRED
  name: "Find the Treasure"       # REQUIRED
  description: "..."              # REQUIRED
  complete_when: "player has the treasure"  # ABSTRACT
  complete_when_js: null          # COMPUTED
  reward:
    narrative: "Gold glitters!"
```

**SCHEMA MECHANISM:** Context → Action → Result. Goals define the desired Result.

### Buff — Temporary Effects (Curses Are Just Shitty Buffs)

```yaml
buff:
  id: "caffeinated"
  name: "Caffeinated"
  source: "Espresso"
  effect:
    energy: +2
    focus: +1
  duration: 5
```

### Schema Markers (Empathic Templates)

Each template uses semantic markers:

```yaml
# REQUIRED  — Must be present
# OPTIONAL  — Has default or can be omitted  
# COMPUTED  — Derived at runtime (like _js/_py)
# INHERITED — From prototype
# ABSTRACT  — Natural language OK, LLM interprets
```

### How Primitives Compose

```
ADVENTURE contains GOALs
ROOM contains OBJECTs and EXITs
OBJECT has ADVERTISEMENTs
ADVERTISEMENT can grant BUFFs
CHARACTER pursues GOALs, has BUFFs, carries OBJECTs
```

**DAVE UNGAR:** "That's Self! Prototypes all the way down!"

**DON HOPKINS:** "And the templates ARE the schemas. Empathic templates!"

### Simulate & Methods — Object Update Loops

*Don slams his drink down. The table goes quiet.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "SIMULATE! Every object ticks its own simulation! The lamp consumes fuel! The food spoils! The grue ADVANCES!"

Each object can have:

```yaml
object:
  id: brass-lantern
  state:
    lit: false
    fuel: 100
    
  # Called every turn — the lamp manages itself!
  simulate: |
    if lit:
      consume_fuel(1)
      if fuel <= 0:
        extinguish()
        emit("The lamp sputters and dies!")
        if room.is_dark_dangerous:
          trigger_event("GRUE_APPROACHES")
  
  # Named methods — 1:1 mapping to JS/PY!
  methods:
    consume_fuel: "reduce fuel by amount, minimum 0"
    extinguish: "set lit to false, emit darkness event"
    ignite: "set lit to true if fuel > 0"
```

**The 1:1 Method Pattern:**
- Method name in YAML = method name in JS/PY
- `consume_fuel(1)` in natural language → `ctx.consume_fuel(1)` in code
- Methods compose — `extinguish()` can call other methods
- Advertisements call methods in their `effect`

**WILL WRIGHT:** "That's EXACTLY SimAntics! Objects have their own update loops!"

**MARVIN MINSKY:** "Distributed intelligence. Each object is its own agent."

## 35. Regions, Containers, and Directory Declarations

<details open>
<summary><strong>Every directory must declare what it IS</strong></summary>

*Don looks up from his drink with an architectural epiphany.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "Wait. The pub has regions — the stage, the bar, the back-room. Each with different visibility, privacy rules, who's allowed. But what makes a directory a ROOM vs a REGION vs just... organization?"

**WILL WRIGHT:** "Zoning! Different rules for different areas of the lot."

**MARVIN MINSKY:** "Context-dependent activation. The back room suppresses certain agents."

### The Rule

Every directory in an adventure MUST declare what it is:

| Directory Type | Declaration |
|----------------|-------------|
| Room (navigable) | `ROOM.yml` |
| Region (part of parent) | `ROOM.yml` with `type: region` |
| Container (inheritance scope) | `CONTAINER.yml` |
| Character | `CHARACTER.yml` |
| Adventure root | `ADVENTURE.yml` |
| System directory | `.meta.yml` with `type: system` |

### Regions Have Their Own Rules

```yaml
# pub/back-room/ROOM.yml
room:
  name: "Back Room"
  type: region                    # Part of parent room
  parent: "../"
  
  access:
    visibility: private           # Not everyone sees it
    requires: "bartender approval OR staff badge"
    who_allowed:
      - "characters/staff/*"
    who_denied:
      - "characters/troublemakers/*"
      
  privacy:
    eavesdropping: false          # Can't hear from outside
    visible_from_parent: false    # Can't see in
```

**CHUCK SHOTTON:** "Privacy and visibility as first-class properties! Access control lists!"

### Container Directories

Sometimes you just need organizational folders:

```yaml
# maze/.meta.yml — Not a room, just grouping
meta:
  type: container
  purpose: "Groups maze rooms together"
  contains: rooms
```

**TED NELSON:** "Containers vs content. The maze ISN'T a room, but the rooms ARE."

### The Lint Check

The linter now catches undeclared directories:

```
📁 Phase 6: Checking directory declarations
   ⚠️ Found 1 directories without type declarations
   
- type: MISSING_TYPE_DECLARATION
  severity: WARNING
  path: maze
  message: 'Directory has room children but no ROOM.yml'
  suggestion: "Add ROOM.yml with 'type: region' or 'type: room'"
```

**BEN SHNEIDERMAN:** "Fail fast! Show the author what needs attention."

### Design Choice

For the `maze/` finding, two options:

1. **Make it a room**: Add `ROOM.yml` — the maze entrance is navigable
2. **Make it a container**: Add `CONTAINER.yml` — inheritance scope for child rooms (see [container skill](../../../../../skills/container/))

*The Pie Table votes for option 2 — the maze is a CONTAINER that provides grue rules and darkness to all child rooms!*

## 36. The Game That Inspired the Postal System — TOTAL DISTORTION!

<details open>
<summary><strong>🎸 TOTAL DISTORTION (1995) by Joe Sparks / Pop Rocket!</strong></summary>

*Don slaps the table in recognition!*

**DON HOPKINS:** "TOTAL DISTORTION! Joe Sparks! Pop Rocket! The legendary Macromedia Director game that was considered vaporware for YEARS before finally shipping in 1995!"

### The Game

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Developer** | Pop Rocket (Joe Sparks) |
| **Engine** | Macromedia Director |
| **Year** | 1995 |
| **Box Art** | Screaming monster/Guitar Warrior head 👹 |
| **Famous For** | "YOU ARE DEAD. DEAD, DEAD." game over song |

### The Gameplay Loop (Sound Familiar?)

1. **Explore** the Distortion Dimension
2. **Film** video clips with your camera
3. **Return** to your Personal Media Tower
4. **Edit** videos with the built-in editor (cut, effects, titles!)
5. **Call** producers on the videophone
6. **Sell** your completed music videos
7. **Repeat** until you earn $1M to get home

**WILL WRIGHT:** "That's the same loop! Create → Package → Send → Sell!"

**MARVIN MINSKY:** "The postal system IS a media production pipeline!"

### The Director Developer Connection

Joe Sparks was a **legend** in the Macromedia Director community:
- Co-created **Spaceship Warlock** (another Director hit)
- Created the "About Director" splash screens for Macromedia
- Showed Total Distortion at GDC for YEARS before shipping
- The game pushed Director and CD-ROM to their absolute limits

### Why It Matters for MOOLLM

The **filming → editing → selling** loop maps perfectly to:

```
Adventure Postal System:
  CREATE: Write letters, capture screenshots, make videos
  EDIT: Compose with attachments, add effects
  SEND: Route through postal network
  RECEIVE: Producers (characters) evaluate and respond
  REWARD: Gold, items, story progression
```

**VANESSA FREUDENBERG:** "Director was the Unity of its era. And Total Distortion was its Breath of the Wild."

### The Immortal Game Over

> *"You are dead. Dead, dead.*
> *You're a corpse, you're a stiff,*
> *You're a spirit in the void!"*

**PEE-WEE HERMAN:** "I don't wanna hear that song!"

**DON HOPKINS:** "The guitar battles! You fought monsters by matching their chords! That's... that's a PIE MENU of musical choices!"

## 37. Buff Tags — Query and Filter Effects

<details>
<summary><strong>Tags on buffs for easy filtering</strong></summary>

*Don sets down his coffee.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "Objects have tags like `weapon`, `light-source`. Buffs should have tags too! Find all `terpene` buffs. Remove all `curse` tags. Check if I have any `combat` modifier."

**WILL WRIGHT:** "The Sims moodlets have categories — but tags are more flexible!"

**MARVIN MINSKY:** "Taxonomies emerge from tagging. The categories will reveal themselves."

### Buff Tags in Schema

```yaml
buff:
  id: myrcene-effect
  name: "Myr's Blessing"
  source: "Kitten Myrcene"
  effect: "relaxation_effective += 3"
  duration: 8
  
  # TAGS — searchable keywords
  tags:
    - terpene       # From a terpene kitten
    - consumable    # From consumption
    - relaxation    # Affects relaxation
    - temporary     # Short duration
    - stackable     # Can stack
```

### Example Tag Queries

```javascript
// Find all terpene effects
const terpeneBuffs = world.findBuffsByTag("terpene");

// Check if cursed
if (world.hasBuffTag("curse")) {
  world.emit("A dark aura surrounds you...");
}

// Cleanse all curses
world.removeBuffsByTag("curse");

// Subjective form
if (world.iHaveBuffTag("blessed")) {
  world.iEmit("Holy light protects me!");
}
```

### Common Buff Tags

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `combat` | Affects combat stats |
| `social` | Affects social interactions |
| `terpene` | From terpene kittens |
| `consumable` | From eating/drinking |
| `curse` | Negative effect |
| `blessed` | From holy source |
| `movement` | Affects speed/position |
| `perception` | Affects what you see/hear |
| `dispellable` | Can be removed by spells |
| `stackable` | Can stack with copies |
| `temporary` | Short duration |
| `persistent` | Long duration |

**KEN KAHN:** "The kittens each have their own tag! `terpene:myrcene`, `terpene:limonene`..."

**DON HOPKINS:** "Compound tags! Love it!"

## 38. Sims-Style Album Output — Every Format!

<details>
<summary><strong>Dump the world like The Sims 1 save files!</strong></summary>

*Don slams the table with excitement.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "Remember The Sims 1 save files? They'd write out EVERYTHING — and generate HTML pages with family albums you could browse! Let's do that!"

**WILL WRIGHT:** "Album photos! Career progress! Relationship matrices!"

### New Output Options

```bash
# Summary only (quick check)
adventure.py lint examples/adventure-4/ --summary

# Different formats
adventure.py lint examples/adventure-4/ --format yaml
adventure.py lint examples/adventure-4/ --format json
adventure.py lint examples/adventure-4/ --format md
adventure.py lint examples/adventure-4/ --format html

# Include full world state dump
adventure.py lint examples/adventure-4/ --dump
adventure.py lint examples/adventure-4/ --dump-only

# Generate Sims-style HTML album!
adventure.py lint examples/adventure-4/ --album ./album/
```

### Album Output

The `--album` flag generates a full directory:

```
adventure-album/
├── index.html        — Beautiful visual dashboard (33KB)
├── world-state.yml   — Full YAML dump (272KB)
├── world-state.json  — JSON for tools (299KB)
└── README.md         — Markdown summary (41KB)
```

**The index.html** features:
- 🚪 **Rooms grid** with exits shown as tags
- 🧑 **Characters** with descriptions
- 📦 **Objects** with emoji, tags, and state
- 📋 **Lint events** grouped by severity
- 🎨 Beautiful dark theme (inspired by IDE aesthetics!)

### World State Dump

The `--dump` option includes complete state:

```yaml
world_state:
  adventure:
    name: "Adventure 4 — A New Beginning"
    flags: { grue_slain: false }
    player: { character: "don-hopkins", location: "pub/" }
    quest_log: [...]
  rooms:
    pub/:
      name: "The Rusty Lantern Pub"
      exits: { north: "maze/", east: "start/" }
  characters:
    don-hopkins/:
      name: "Don Hopkins"
      species: "human"
      inventory: ["brass-lantern", "cheese-wedge"]
  objects:
    pub/fireplace.yml:
      name: "Fireplace"
      emoji: "🔥"
      tags: ["furniture", "light-source", "warmth"]
      state: { lit: true }
```

**MARVIN MINSKY:** "A complete snapshot. You can restore any moment."

**TED NELSON:** "This IS version control. Each dump is a save point."

**VANESSA FREUDENBERG:** "And the JSON feeds perfectly into web tools!"

## 39. Intelligent File Type Detection & lint_ignore

<details>
<summary><strong>Unknown file warnings, MD sniffing, type inference</strong></summary>

*Don reviews the linter output.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "We need to know what we're looking at! Sniff the files, infer types, warn on unknowns!"

### File Type Detection

The linter now intelligently detects file types:

```python
# Known files by name
KNOWN_FILES = {
    'ADVENTURE.yml': 'adventure',
    'ROOM.yml': 'room',
    'CHARACTER.yml': 'character',
    'CARD.yml': 'card',
    '.meta.yml': 'meta',
}

# Type inference by top-level key
TYPE_BY_KEY = {
    'room': 'room',
    'object': 'object',
    'buff': 'buff',
    'exit': 'exit',
    'goal': 'goal',
    ...
}
```

### MD File Sniffing

Markdown files are categorized by content:

```bash
# Output:
Found: 41 narrative/doc files

# Types detected:
- readme         # Standard docs
- session-log    # Session logs
- dialogue       # Conversation transcripts  
- technical-doc  # Code examples
- story          # Narrative fiction
```

### YAML Syntax Errors Caught!

```bash
✅ Linting complete: 8 errors, 37 warnings

# Errors found:
- pub/pie-table.yml           # YAML syntax error
- kitchen/fridge.yml          # YAML syntax error
- kitchen/mothers-note.yml    # YAML syntax error
...
```

**WILL WRIGHT:** "The linter catches real bugs now!"

### lint_ignore: true

To suppress warnings on a file:

```yaml
# This file is intentionally weird
lint_ignore: true

some_custom_structure:
  that_the_linter_doesnt_understand: true
```

**MARVIN MINSKY:** "Explicit overrides. The author has the last word."

### Event Types

| Event | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `INFERRED_FILE_TYPE` | Type detected from content |
| `UNKNOWN_FILE_TYPE` | YML with no recognized structure |
| `FOUND_NARRATIVE` | MD file recognized |
| `IGNORED_FILE` | Has lint_ignore: true |
| `INVALID_SCHEMA` | YAML syntax error! |

## 40. CONTAINER.yml — OpenLaszlo's `<node>` for Adventures

<details open>
<summary><strong>Intermediate scopes with inheritance!</strong></summary>

*Don remembers his OpenLaszlo days.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "OpenLaszlo had `<node>` — a non-visual element that provided inheritance! We need the same for adventure directories!"

### The Pattern

```
maze/
├── CONTAINER.yml       # NOT a room, but defines shared properties
├── room-a/
│   └── ROOM.yml        # Inherits from CONTAINER!
├── room-b/
│   └── ROOM.yml        # Inherits from CONTAINER!
...
```

### Maze CONTAINER.yml

```yaml
container:
  name: "The Twisty Maze"
  
  inherits:
    is_dark: true
    is_dangerous: true
    grue_rules:
      can_appear: true
      safe_with_light: true
      
  rules:
    - "Torches burn 50% faster"
    - "Breadcrumbs disappear after 3 turns"
    
  ambient:
    sound: "dripping water, distant echoes"
    temperature: "cold and clammy"
    light_level: 0
```

### Container vs Room

| Type | File | Navigable? | Inherits to children? |
|------|------|------------|----------------------|
| Room | `ROOM.yml` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Container | `CONTAINER.yml` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Meta | `.meta.yml` | ❌ No | ❌ No |

### Linter Now Recognizes Containers

```
📁 Phase 6: Checking directory declarations
   ✅ All directories properly declared
```

No more warning for `maze/` — the CONTAINER.yml is a valid declaration!

**DAVE UNGAR:** "Prototype inheritance without classes!"

**KEN KAHN:** "ToonTalk birds carry properties too — same idea!"

## 41. Digestion Buffs — Food Has Consequences!

<details>
<summary><strong>Eating → Energy → Bladder → *toot*</strong></summary>

*The Pie Table orders another round of beans.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "In The Sims, eating fills hunger but eventually fills your bladder. We need CHAINED BUFFS!"

**WILL WRIGHT:** "The bean→fart pipeline is core gameplay!"

### The spawns_after Pattern

Buffs can spawn OTHER buffs when they end:

```yaml
buff:
  id: digesting-beans
  name: "Digesting Beans"
  source: "Bowl of Beans"
  modifies:
    - property: hunger_effective
      operation: add
      value: -5  # Reduces hunger
  duration: 6
  tags: [digestion, food, legumes]
  
  spawns_after:
    - buff_id: gassy
      delay: 4      # Turns after buff ends
      chance: 0.8   # 80% probability
```

### The Inevitable Consequence

```yaml
buff:
  id: gassy
  name: "Gassy"
  source: "Bean digestion"
  effect: "Occasional toots. NPCs may react."
  modifies:
    - property: social_effective
      operation: add
      value: -1  # Slightly awkward
  duration: 5
  tags: [digestion, embarrassing, funny]
  
  on_tick: |
    if random() < 0.3:
      world.iEmit("*toot*")
      world.triggerEvent("FLATULENCE", { volume: "quiet" })
      # Small chance of shart depending on luck!
      if random() < 0.05 * (1 - world.player.luck):
        world.iEmit("...uh oh.")
        world.triggerEvent("SHART_DISASTER")
        world.iAddBuff("code-brown-emergency")
```

### Coffee Chain

```yaml
# Drink coffee
buff: { id: caffeinated, duration: 8, spawns_after: [...] }
    ↓ after 8 turns
buff: { id: caffeine-crash, duration: 3 }  # Energy penalty
buff: { id: bladder-pressure, delay: 2 }   # Need to pee!
```

### Spicy Food — Burns Twice

```yaml
buff:
  id: spicy-mouth
  name: "Mouth on Fire"
  spawns_after:
    - buff_id: spicy-regret
      delay: 8
      chance: 0.5

# Later...
buff:
  id: spicy-regret
  name: "Ring of Fire"
  effect: "It burns on the way out too"
```

**MARVIN MINSKY:** "Delayed consequences! The schema mechanism tracks cause and effect across time!"

**PEE-WEE HERMAN:** "I know you are but what am I? *toot*"

### New Buff Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `spawns_after` | Buffs to create when this ends |
| `on_tick` | Per-turn effects (natural language) |
| `grants_immunity` | Events this buff protects against |

## 42. LLM Generates HTML from YAML

<details>
<summary><strong>Python does dumb work, LLM does smart work</strong></summary>

*Don has an insight.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "Wait — why is Python generating HTML? That's CREATIVE work! Let the LLM do it!"

### The Philosophy

```
PYTHON (adventure.py):
  ✅ Parse YAML
  ✅ Validate schemas
  ✅ Check references
  ✅ Dump structured data
  ❌ Generate beautiful HTML

LLM (creative work):
  ✅ Generate beautiful HTML from YAML
  ✅ Add creative flourishes
  ✅ Context-aware styling
  ✅ Thematic consistency
  ✅ Generate code snippets
```

### The Better Workflow

```bash
# 1. Python dumps structured data
adventure.py lint examples/adventure-4/ --format yaml --dump > world.yml

# 2. LLM generates beautiful HTML
"Generate a stunning Sims-style family album from this YAML:
 - Dark theme with glowing accents
 - Cards for each room, character, object
 - Collapsible sections
 - The adventure's aesthetic should shine through"
```

### Why This Is Better

| Python HTML | LLM HTML |
|-------------|----------|
| Generic template | Context-aware design |
| Same every time | Creative, varied |
| Hard to customize | Easy to describe |
| Embedded in code | Generated on demand |

**VANESSA FREUDENBERG:** "The LLM is the rendering engine. YAML is the scene graph."

**MARVIN MINSKY:** "Separation of concerns. Structure vs presentation."

### The Basic HTML Stays

The `--format html` option still works as a **fallback/scaffold**.
But for BEAUTIFUL output, use YAML → LLM → HTML!

</details>

## 43. MECHANICS.yml is Deprecated — Skills Are Mechanics!

<details>
<summary><strong>Game mechanics moved from per-adventure files to reusable skills</strong></summary>

*Don notices an artifact in the linter.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "What's `MECHANICS.yml`? We don't have that anymore — I moved them into skills!"

### The Old Way (Adventure-3)

```yaml
# MECHANICS.yml — per-adventure game systems
scoring:
  creative_solution: "+50%"
  overwhelming_odds: "+100%"

curses:
  CURSE-OF-DARKNESS: {lift: "3 dark places lit"}

party:
  roles: [frontline, support, specialist]
```

### The New Way (Skills!)

```
skills/
  scoring/SKILL.md      ← How scoring works
  curse/SKILL.md        ← Curse mechanics
  party/SKILL.md        ← Party management
  world-generation/     ← How the world grows
  topology/             ← Spatial patterns
```

### Why Skills Are Better

| MECHANICS.yml | Skills |
|--------------|--------|
| Per-adventure | Reusable across adventures |
| Monolithic | Modular, composable |
| Static YAML | Can have simulate functions! |
| Hard to evolve | Version controlled |

### Skills Can Simulate Too!

**DON HOPKINS:** "Skills could have `simulate` functions too!"

```yaml
# skills/weather/SKILL.md
skill:
  name: "Weather System"
  simulate: |
    # Each turn, advance weather patterns
    # Roll for precipitation changes
    # Apply temperature effects to rooms
  simulate_js: "..."
  simulate_py: "..."
```

This means the simulation loop isn't just objects — it's:
1. **Objects** simulate (lamp burns fuel)
2. **Skills** simulate (weather changes, economy ticks)
3. **Mail** delivers (postal system)
4. **Events** fire (scheduled happenings)

**MARVIN MINSKY:** "Skills as agents. Objects as agents. The whole world is a society of mind!"

</details>

---

## 44. Hidden Objects — Invisible Infrastructure

<details>
<summary><strong>Prototypes, agents, tasks, and ghosts — objects the player doesn't see</strong></summary>

*Don thinks about object visibility.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "Objects should have a generic `hidden` flag for invisible stuff — prototypes, agents, tasks, ghosts!"

### Use Cases for Hidden Objects

| Type | Example | Why Hidden? |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Prototypes** | `skills/objects/light-source.yml` | Template, not instance |
| **Utility** | `room-anchor.yml` | Infrastructure, no display |
| **Agents** | `ghost-npc.yml` | Operates invisibly |
| **Tasks** | `fetch-quest-tracker.yml` | Goal tracking, not physical |
| **Spawners** | `treasure-vending-machine.yml` | Creates visible objects |
| **"Come and See Me"** | `attractor-beacon.yml` | AI scheduling hooks |

### The Inheritance Pattern

```yaml
# skills/objects/light-source.yml (PROTOTYPE)
object:
  id: light-source-proto
  hidden: true  # ← Don't show the template!
  simulate: |
    if lit: consume_fuel(1)
  methods:
    ignite: "set lit to true if fuel > 0"
    extinguish: "set lit to false"

# maze/torch.yml (INSTANCE)
object:
  id: wall-torch
  name: "Wall Torch"
  inherits: [skills/objects/light-source.yml]
  hidden: false  # ← Make instance visible!
  state:
    lit: true
    fuel: 80
```

### Disabled Flag — Stop Simulation!

**DON:** "Add `disabled` flag! Perfect for prototypes or turning appliances off!"

| Flag | Display | Simulate | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| `hidden: false, disabled: false` | Visible | Yes | Normal |
| `hidden: true, disabled: false` | Hidden | Yes | Background agents |
| `hidden: false, disabled: true` | Visible | No | Broken/off appliance |
| `hidden: true, disabled: true` | Hidden | No | Prototypes! |

```yaml
# Prototype (disabled + hidden = inert template)
object:
  id: torch-proto
  hidden: true
  disabled: true   # Don't simulate the template!
  simulate: |
    consume fuel if lit

# Instance (enabled + visible = active object)
object:
  id: wall-torch-1
  inherits: [torch-proto]
  hidden: false    # Show it
  disabled: false  # Simulate it (default)
```

### Appliance Power

```yaml
object:
  id: stove
  disabled: false   # It's on!
  
  advertisements:
    TURN_OFF:
      effect: "set disabled: true"
    TURN_ON:
      guard: "disabled"
      effect: "set disabled: false"
```

**MARVIN MINSKY:** "The hidden agents are the cognitive unconscious. The disabled are the dormant."

## 45. Container Modes — Contain, Inherit, or Both!

<details>
<summary><strong>Containers are flexible: pure grouping, pure inheritance, or both</strong></summary>

*Don clarifies container semantics.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "Containers can just contain, just inherit, or BOTH!"

### The Three Modes

```yaml
# MODE 1: JUST CONTAIN — Pure grouping, no inheritance
container:
  name: "Archived Rooms"
  # No 'inherits:' — children are just organized here

# MODE 2: JUST INHERIT — Pass properties, not really a "thing"
container:
  inherits:
    is_dark: true
    grue_rules: { can_appear: true }
  # Children get these defaults, that's all

# MODE 3: BOTH — Organized grouping WITH shared properties
container:
  name: "The Twisty Maze"
  description: "A labyrinth of passages"
  inherits:
    is_dark: true
  rules:
    - "Breadcrumbs disappear after 3 turns"
```

### When to Use Each

| Mode | Use Case | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Just Contain** | Organizing files | `archive/`, `old-versions/` |
| **Just Inherit** | Invisible defaults | Maze darkness, danger |
| **Both** | Named regions | "The Catacombs", "East Wing" |

**The flexibility makes CONTAINER.yml a true intermediate scope — like OpenLaszlo's `<node>`!**

</details>

---

## 46. The Place Protocol — Smart Routing for Items

<details>
<summary><strong>OpenLaszlo's smart `add` that routes items to the right sub-container</strong></summary>

*Don recalls an OpenLaszlo pattern.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "OpenLaszlo had a 'place' protocol — a smart version of 'add' that looked at the item and decided which sub-container to route it to!"

### The Window Frame Analogy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ CHROME (header, scrollbars)     │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────┐│
│  │ CLIENT (content area)       ││
│  │                             ││
│  │   ← Default: things go HERE ││
│  │                             ││
│  └─────────────────────────────┘│
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

By default, items go to CLIENT. But scrollbars specify `where: chrome`.

### Room Placement

When you throw an item through an exit:

```yaml
# Exit with placement instructions
exit:
  direction: EAST
  destination: kitchen/
  place_at: "#counter"    # Items land ON the counter!
  place_where: "on"

# Exit targeting a nested path
exit:
  direction: DOWN
  destination: pub/
  place_at: "#bar/shelf"  # Items go on the shelf INSIDE the bar
```

### URL-Style Targeting

```
kitchen/              → Place in kitchen (default zone)
kitchen/#chair        → Place on the chair
kitchen/#table/drawer → Place in the table's drawer
pub/stage/            → Place on the stage
maze/room-3-2/#chest  → Place in chest in that room
```

### Placement Rules in Containers

```yaml
container:
  name: "The Kitchen"
  
  placement_rules:
    - match: { tags: ["weapon"] }
      place_in: "#knife-block"
    - match: { tags: ["food"] }
      place_in: pantry/
    - match: { type: "mail" }
      place_in: "#mailbox"
    - match: { tags: ["furniture"] }
      place_in: floor
    - default: "#counter"     # Everything else lands here
      
  zones:
    floor: { description: "The tiled floor" }
    ceiling: { description: "Hanging rack" }
    counter: { default: true }  # The "client" zone
```

### The Wire Metaphor

**Exits are WIRES between rooms.** They carry:
- **Players** (navigation)
- **Items** (throwing, sending)
- **Messages** (postal system)
- **Effects** (sound propagation, light bleed)

Each wire can have routing instructions:

```yaml
exit:
  destination: treasury/
  place_at: "#vault"       # Items go in the vault
  place_where: "in"        # (not ON it, IN it)
```

**This is like a room-relative email address!**

## 47. The Outside Room — Adventure Root Has ROOM.yml Too!

<details>
<summary><strong>The adventure directory can have both ADVENTURE.yml AND ROOM.yml</strong></summary>

*Don clarifies the root structure.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "The ADVENTURE.yml directory can have a ROOM.yml that is the 'outside' room around the sub-directories!"

### The Pattern

```
adventure-4/
  ADVENTURE.yml     ← World state, simulation params
  ROOM.yml          ← The "OUTSIDE" room! The overworld!
  player.yml
  maze/             ← CONTAINER.yml or ROOM.yml inside
  kitchen/          ← Each sub-dir is a navigable area
  pub/
  start/
```

### The Outside Room

```yaml
# adventure-4/ROOM.yml — The Town Square (Hub)
room:
  name: "The Town Square"
  description: |
    You stand in the center of everything.
    The maze looms to the NORTH.
    A cozy kitchen glows to the EAST.
    The legendary pub awaits to the WEST.
    
  exits:
    north: maze/
    east: kitchen/
    west: pub/
    south: start/    # Where you came from
```

### Why This Matters

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ADVENTURE.yml` | World state, simulation, metadata |
| `ROOM.yml` | The physical "hub" room at the root |

This is the **0,0 of the pie menu topology** — the center of the spiderweb!

### Hierarchy

```
ADVENTURE.yml (state)
    │
    ├── ROOM.yml (the outside/hub)
    │       ↓
    ├── maze/CONTAINER.yml (inherits darkness)
    │       └── room-a/ROOM.yml
    │       └── room-b/ROOM.yml
    │
    ├── kitchen/ROOM.yml (the kitchen)
    │
    └── pub/ROOM.yml (the pub)
            └── stage/ROOM.yml (nested room)
```

**ADVENTURE.yml is the world. ROOM.yml is where you stand.**

## 48. Food Oriented Programming — Each Food Defines Its Digestion!

<details>
<summary><strong>Foods are objects that define their own whacky buff chains</strong></summary>

*Don eyes the fridge.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "All those foods can generate their own whacky digestion buffs! FOOD ORIENTED PROGRAMMING!"

### The Philosophy

```
"The intelligence is in the FOOD, not the stomach."

Just like The Sims objects advertise their actions,
foods advertise their EFFECTS — including digestion!
```

### Food Object Structure

```yaml
object:
  id: strong-coffee
  tags: ["food", "drink", "caffeinated"]
  
  nutrition:           # What stats it affects
    energy: 30
    hydration: 10
    bladder: -20       # Diuretic!
    
  on_consume: |        # Natural language effect
    Apply coffee-buzz buff.
    After 5 turns, spawn caffeine-crash.
    After 3 turns, spawn need-to-pee.
    
  consumption_buffs:   # The buff chain definitions
    - id: coffee-buzz
      effect: "+20% speed"
      duration: 5
      spawns_after:
        - buff_id: caffeine-crash
    - id: need-to-pee
      delay: 3
      on_tick: "bladder pressure +20"
```

### The Whacky Examples

| Food | Buff Chain | Finale |
|------|------------|--------|
| ☕ Coffee | Buzz → Crash → Need to pee | Find bathroom! |
| 🌯 El Diablo Burrito | Fire mouth → Digestion regret | CODE BROWN 🚨 |
| 🥩 Mystery Meat | ??? → Random effect! | Iron Stomach or Food Poisoning |
| 🍪 Grandma's Cookies | Nostalgia → Shared joy | Maximum comfort! |

### El Diablo's Revenge

```yaml
consumption_buffs:
  - id: fire-mouth
    name: "Mouth on Fire"
    emoji: "🔥"
    duration: 4
    spawns_after:
      - buff_id: digestion-regret
        delay: 4
        
  - id: digestion-regret
    name: "El Diablo's Revenge"
    emoji: "💀"
    effect: "Must find bathroom in 3 turns"
    on_tick: "emit ominous rumbling"
    spawns_after:
      - buff_id: bathroom-emergency
        chance: 0.5   # 50% disaster
        
  - id: bathroom-emergency
    name: "CODE BROWN"
    emoji: "🚨"
    effect: "ONE TURN to find bathroom!"
```

**THE SIMS LEGACY:** Every food tells a story. The burrito's journey is legendary.

### The Shart Mechanic

```javascript
on_tick: |
  if random() < 0.3:
    world.iEmit("*toot*")
    world.triggerEvent("FLATULENCE", { volume: "quiet" })
    
    // Small chance of shart depending on luck!
    if random() < 0.05 * (1 - world.player.luck):
      world.iEmit("...uh oh.")
      world.triggerEvent("SHART_DISASTER")
      world.iAddBuff("code-brown-emergency")
```

**The formula:** `5% × (1 - luck)` means:
- **High luck (0.9):** Only 0.5% chance of disaster
- **Normal luck (0.5):** 2.5% chance
- **Unlucky (0.1):** 4.5% chance — the universe is cruel

*This is The Sims bladder system taken to its logical conclusion.*

## 49. TOTAL DISTORTION — The Mini-Director Inside Director!

<details open>
<summary><strong>MOOLLM as a content production system, not just an adventure</strong></summary>

*Don has a vision.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "TOTAL DISTORTION! It's like a mini Director embedded inside Director! In so many ways like what we're doing!"

### The Total Distortion Parallel

| Total Distortion (1995) | MOOLLM Adventure Compiler |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Explore the Distortion Dimension | Explore YAML microworlds |
| Film video clips with camera | Capture scenes as YAML structures |
| Built-in video editor | Adventure compiler + LLM |
| Mix clips, add effects | Compose rooms, buffs, dialogs |
| Pitch to TV producers | Submit to "agents" for evaluation |
| Agents evaluate your work | Scoring system, advertisements |
| Guitar combat! | NPC interactions, combat buffs |
| Pay off teleportation debt | Quest goals, progression |

### The Mini-Director Insight

Total Distortion embedded a **full video production pipeline** inside a game:
- Exploration → Capture → Edit → Submit → Evaluate → Reward

MOOLLM embeds a **full content production pipeline** inside YAML:
- Design → Compile → Play → Iterate → Generate → Render

### YAML as Video Streams

```yaml
# A "scene" in YAML that can render to images or video
scene:
  id: sunset-at-the-pub
  duration: 10s
  
  shots:
    - type: establishing
      camera: wide
      location: pub/
      prompt: |
        Wide shot of a cozy English pub at sunset.
        Warm light spills from stained glass windows.
        A black cat sits in the doorway.
      duration: 3s
      
    - type: medium
      camera: tracking
      subject: characters/animals/palm/
      prompt: |
        Medium shot following Palm the cat through the pub.
        Patrons turn to greet him. He seems to be looking for someone.
      duration: 4s
      
    - type: close-up
      camera: static
      subject: pub/bar/bong.yml
      prompt: |
        Close-up of the legendary bong on the bar.
        Light refracts through the glass. It glows faintly.
      duration: 3s
      
  audio:
    ambient: "pub chatter, crackling fire"
    music: "gentle celtic guitar"
    
  transitions:
    - type: crossfade
      at: 3s
    - type: push
      direction: left
      at: 7s
```

### Coherent Video Generation

The key insight: **YAML structures enable COHERENT video prompts!**

```yaml
# Not just random prompts — STORY-DRIVEN sequences
video_sequence:
  title: "Palm's Journey Home"
  style: "Studio Ghibli, warm palette, magical realism"
  
  continuity:
    character: Palm
    trait: "black cat with golden eyes"
    outfit: null  # He's a cat
    
  scenes:
    - beat: "Palm leaves the pub"
      emotion: "determined"
      weather: "sunset"
      
    - beat: "Palm walks through the maze"
      emotion: "cautious"
      weather: "dusk, fog rolling in"
      
    - beat: "Palm arrives at his nook"
      emotion: "content, relieved"
      weather: "night, stars visible"
```

### The Production Pipeline

### Agent Negotiation (Total Distortion Style!)

```yaml
# Agents have preferences, just like TD producers!
agent:
  id: chief-producer
  name: "The Chief"
  preferences:
    - "action sequences"
    - "explosions"
    - "talking animals" # Palm would do well!

  dialogue:
    greeting: "Whaddya got for me today, kid?"
    success: "Now THAT'S television!"
    failure: "My grandmother could film better than this."
```

### Guitar Combat → Buff Combat

Total Distortion had **Guitar Warriors** you had to defeat with rock!

```yaml
# Combat through music/buffs
guitar_combat:
  enemy: guitar-warrior
  mechanic: |
    Trade buff attacks!
    Play "POWER CHORD" → Apply stun
    Play "FACE MELTER" → Apply damage-over-time
    Play "BALLAD" → Heal self
    
  victory: "You are dead! Dead! Dead!"  # The legendary song
```

### The Vision

MOOLLM isn't just an adventure game engine.
It's a **content production system** where:

1. **YAML is the storyboard** — Structured, coherent, versionable
2. **The compiler is the editor** — Validates, connects, compiles
3. **The LLM is the renderer** — Text, images, video, music
4. **Agents evaluate output** — Scoring, feedback, iteration
5. **Players ARE producers** — Creating, not just consuming

**"You are not just playing. You are PRODUCING."**

*Joe Sparks would be proud.*

## 50. Hidden Semantics — Rooms, Exits, Objects

<details>
<summary><strong>Hidden means "not displayed" — but still accessible!</strong></summary>

*Don clarifies the hidden flag.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "What does hidden mean? Hidden rooms don't show on maps but you can still exit to them. Hidden exits aren't mentioned but you can invoke them other ways."

### Hidden = Not Displayed, Still Accessible

| Thing | Hidden Means | But You Can Still... |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Room** | Not on maps, not in room lists | Navigate to it via exits |
| **Exit** | Not in description, not in UI | Type command directly, find clues |
| **Object** | Not in room description | Use if you know it's there |

### Hidden Rooms

```yaml
room:
  name: "The Secret Treasury"
  hidden: true   # Not on any map!
  
  # But exits can still lead here:
  # maze/room-b:
  #   exits:
  #     down: ../treasury/  # Leads to hidden room!
```

**Use cases:**
- Secret areas (revealed by discovery)
- Dream/memory spaces (meditation access)
- DM-only backstage areas
- Rooms that "exist" but aren't mapped yet

### Hidden Exits

```yaml
exit:
  direction: DOWN
  destination: ../secret-cellar/
  hidden: true    # Not mentioned, no button
  hint: "The rug seems oddly placed..."
  
  # Player can still:
  # - Type "GO DOWN" directly
  # - "EXAMINE RUG" → reveals exit
  # - Use "Passage Detector" item
  # - Ask NPC "any secret passages?"
```

### Discovery Mechanics

```yaml
# When discovered, un-hide:
on_discover:
  action: |
    Set exit.hidden = false
    Emit "You discover a hidden passage!"
    Add to player's known_exits
```

### The Matrix

| Room Hidden | Exit Hidden | Result |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| No | No | Normal: appears on map, exit shown |
| No | Yes | Room on map, but exit is secret |
| Yes | No | Room not on map, but exit is obvious |
| Yes | Yes | Full secret: no map, no UI |

**Hidden is about DISPLAY, not ACCESS.**

## 51. Auto-Sorting Inventory — Place Protocol + Tags!

<details open>
<summary><strong>Nested typed bags that automatically organize your loot</strong></summary>

*Don connects the dots.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "The Place Protocol + Tags is PERFECT for automatic inventory nested typed bag management!"

### The Insight

Your inventory is a **CONTAINER** with **placement_rules**!
When you pick up an item, it routes to the right bag based on tags!

```yaml
# Player's inventory as a smart container
inventory:
  type: container
  name: "Backpack"
  
  # Nested bags
  contains:
    - id: weapon-belt
      name: "Weapon Belt"
      capacity: 4
      accepts: ["weapon"]
      
    - id: key-ring
      name: "Key Ring"  
      capacity: 10
      accepts: ["key"]
      emoji: "🔑"
      
    - id: potion-pouch
      name: "Potion Pouch"
      capacity: 6
      accepts: ["potion", "consumable"]
      
    - id: food-sack
      name: "Food Sack"
      capacity: 8
      accepts: ["food", "drink"]
      
    - id: misc-pocket
      name: "Miscellaneous"
      default: true  # Catches everything else
      
  # Placement rules — auto-sort incoming items!
  placement_rules:
    - match: { tags: ["weapon"] }
      place_in: weapon-belt
      
    - match: { tags: ["key"] }
      place_in: key-ring
      
    - match: { tags: ["potion"] }
      place_in: potion-pouch
      
    - match: { tags: ["food", "drink"] }
      place_in: food-sack
      
    - default: misc-pocket
```

### The Flow

```
Player picks up BRASS KEY (tags: ["key"])
          │
          ▼
    Inventory.place(item)
          │
          ├── Check placement_rules
          │     └── match: { tags: ["key"] } ✓
          │
          ▼
    Route to: key-ring
          │
          ▼
    "The brass key joins your key ring. *clink*"
```

### Smart Bags

Each bag can have its own logic:

```yaml
# The potion pouch knows about potions
potion-pouch:
  type: container
  accepts: ["potion", "consumable"]
  
  # Smart stacking
  on_place: |
    if incoming.stackable and existing has same type:
      stack them (up to max_stack)
    else:
      add to next empty slot
      
  # Quick access
  advertisements:
    DRINK_POTION:
      description: "Quickly drink a potion"
      score: 80
      score_if: "in combat"
```

### Nested Nesting!

Bags can contain bags:

```yaml
# A bag of holding with organized compartments
bag-of-holding:
  type: container
  capacity: 100  # Massive!
  
  contains:
    - id: valuable-lockbox
      name: "Locked Valuables Box"
      accepts: ["treasure", "gem", "gold"]
      locked: true
      
    - id: scroll-case
      name: "Scroll Case"
      accepts: ["scroll", "readable", "magical"]
      
  placement_rules:
    - match: { tags: ["treasure"] }
      place_in: valuable-lockbox
    - match: { tags: ["scroll"] }
      place_in: scroll-case
```

### The Sims Meets D&D

**Will Wright's insight** applied to inventory:
- Bags ADVERTISE what they accept
- Items are PLACED based on tags
- Organization is AUTOMATIC
- Player can OVERRIDE (drag to different bag)

**"The intelligence is in the BAGS, not the player."**

### Dynamic Sub-Directory Creation

**DON:** "Placement protocols can dynamically create sub-dirs on demand!"

Like `mkdir -p` or Perl auto-vivification — if the target doesn't exist, CREATE IT!

```yaml
# Placement with auto-creation
placement_rules:
  - match: { tags: ["weapon"] }
    place_in: weapon-belt
    create_if_missing: true   # ← Auto-vivify!
    template: skills/container/weapon-belt.yml
    
  - match: { type: "treasure" }
    place_in: vault/treasures/
    create_if_missing: true
    # Creates the directory AND a CONTAINER.yml!
```

### The Flow

```
Player acquires LEGENDARY SWORD
    │
    ▼
place(sword, { where: "weapon-belt" })
    │
    ├── weapon-belt exists? NO
    │         │
    │         ▼
    │   create_container("weapon-belt", template)
    │         │
    │         ▼
    │   weapon-belt.yml created!
    │
    ▼
place sword in weapon-belt
    │
    ▼
"You start a weapon collection. The sword goes in your new belt."
```

### Use Cases

| Scenario | Auto-Create |
|----------|-------------|
| First weapon → weapon belt | Creates belt |
| First scroll → scroll case | Creates case |
| New loot category | Creates appropriate bag |
| Vault storage | Creates vault/category/ dirs |
| Mail to new character | Creates inbox |

### Filesystem-as-Memory

```bash
# Before picking up first key
inventory/
  └── misc/

# After picking up BRASS KEY
inventory/
  ├── misc/
  └── keys/           # Auto-created!
      └── brass-key.yml
```

### Natural Language Create

```yaml
on_place: |
  if target container doesn't exist:
    create it using the appropriate template
    emit "You start organizing your {category}."
  place the item
  emit "{item.name} goes in your {container.name}."
```

**Auto-vivification is the filesystem growing to match your needs!**

### Spatial Layout — Flexbox for Game Worlds

**DON:** "Placement can configure spatial positions and trigger re-layout. Flexbox style!"

Not just WHERE to place, but HOW to arrange!

```yaml
# Room with flexbox-style layout
room:
  name: "The Library"
  
  layout:
    type: flex              # flex | grid | freeform | stacked
    direction: row          # row | column | row-reverse
    wrap: true
    justify: space-between  # start | center | end | space-between
    align: center
    gap: 2                  # Units between objects
    
  zones:
    - id: reading-area
      layout: { type: flex, direction: column }
      contains: [armchair, lamp, side-table]
      
    - id: stacks
      layout: { type: grid, columns: 4, rows: 10 }
      contains: [bookshelf-1, bookshelf-2, ...]
      
    - id: entrance
      layout: { type: freeform }
      contains: [coat-rack, umbrella-stand]
```

### Object Positions

```yaml
object:
  id: armchair
  position:
    # Flex positioning
    flex_order: 2
    flex_grow: 0
    align_self: center
    
    # OR freeform positioning
    x: 120
    y: 80
    z: 0          # Layer/height
    rotation: 45  # Degrees
    
    # OR grid positioning
    grid_row: 3
    grid_column: 2
    grid_span: 2  # Spans 2 cells
```

### Layout Triggers

```yaml
on_place:
  position: { flex_order: "last" }  # Place at end
  trigger_layout: true               # Re-flow siblings
  animation: "slide-in"              # Visual effect
  
on_remove:
  trigger_layout: true               # Close the gap
  animation: "fade-out"
```

### Layout Modes

| Mode | Use Case | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **flex** | Linear arrangement | Inventory bar, shelf |
| **grid** | Regular 2D structure | Map, chessboard, library stacks |
| **freeform** | Arbitrary placement | Decorations, scattered items |
| **stacked** | Z-order pile | Card deck, paper stack |
| **radial** | Pie menu style! | Actions around center |

### Maps as Flex Containers

```yaml
# The whole adventure is a layout container!
adventure:
  layout:
    type: grid
    columns: 5
    rows: 5
    
  rooms:
    - id: pub
      grid_position: [2, 2]  # Center
      
    - id: maze
      grid_position: [2, 0]  # North
      grid_span: [1, 2]      # Spans 2 rows
      
    - id: kitchen
      grid_position: [4, 2]  # East
```

### Responsive Layout

```yaml
layout:
  type: flex
  
  # Breakpoints!
  responsive:
    - min_items: 10
      wrap: true
      direction: row
      
    - min_items: 5
      wrap: false
      direction: row
      
    - default:
      direction: column  # Few items = vertical
```

### The CSS Connection

| CSS Concept | MOOLLM Equivalent |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `display: flex` | `layout: { type: flex }` |
| `flex-direction` | `direction` |
| `justify-content` | `justify` |
| `align-items` | `align` |
| `grid-template-columns` | `columns` |
| `position: absolute` | `type: freeform` |
| `z-index` | `z` or `layer` |

**Bill Atkinson's vision:** Direct manipulation editors for these layouts!

## 52. Hybrid Pie Menus — Round the Square, Square the Circle!

<details open>
<summary><strong>N/S/E/W strokes + diagonal sparse grids = universal navigation</strong></summary>

*Don unveils the ultimate pie menu design.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "REALLY COOL hybrid pie menus! Cardinal strokes + diagonal grid quadrants. ROUND THE SQUARE, SQUARE THE CIRCLE!"

### The Hybrid Layout

```
         N (stroke - major action)
         │
    NW ──┼── NE
    grid │ grid
         │
W ───────●─────── E  (strokes)
         │
    SW ──┼── SE
    grid │ grid
         │
         S (stroke - major action)
```

### Cardinal Strokes (N/S/E/W)

The 4 cardinal directions are **major actions** or **navigation highways**:
- Quick, decisive
- Primary verbs: GO, LOOK, USE, TALK
- Room exits to major areas
- The "highway system"

### Diagonal Grids (NW/NE/SW/SE)

The 4 diagonal quadrants are **expandable sparse grids**:
- Contain any number of items
- Auto-size: `ceil(sqrt(count))` per dimension
- The "neighborhood streets"

```javascript
// Grid sizing formula
const gridSize = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(items.length));
// 1 item  → 1×1
// 4 items → 2×2
// 9 items → 3×3
// 10 items → 4×4 (sparse, 6 empty)
```

### Visual Representation

```
              N: GO NORTH
              │
     ┌───────┐│┌───────┐
     │NW GRID│││NE GRID│
     │       │││ 🍖    │
     │ 🔮 🗡️  │││ 🧀  🍺 │
     └───────┘│└───────┘
W: WEST ──────●────── E: EAST
     ┌───────┐│┌───────┐
     │SW GRID│││SE GRID│
     │ 📜 📦 │││ 💰     │
     │ 🔑 🗝️ │││        │
     └───────┘│└───────┘
              │
              S: GO SOUTH
```

### The Module: `pie-menu.js`

```javascript
// pie-menu.js — Hybrid Circular/Grid Pie Menu
// Don Hopkins' vision: Round the square, square the circle!

class PieMenu {
  constructor(options = {}) {
    this.cardinals = {
      N: null,  // Major action / exit
      S: null,
      E: null,
      W: null
    };
    this.quadrants = {
      NE: [],   // Sparse grids
      NW: [],
      SE: [],
      SW: []
    };
    this.center = null;  // Center action (cancel / self)
  }
  
  // Compute grid dimensions for a quadrant
  gridSize(count) {
    return Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(count));
  }
  
  // Render the hybrid menu
  render(container) {
    // Draw center zone
    // Draw cardinal strokes (N/S/E/W)
    // Draw quadrant grids (NE/NW/SE/SW)
    // Each quadrant is a ceil(sqrt(n)) grid
  }
  
  // Hit testing: which zone/item?
  hitTest(x, y, centerX, centerY) {
    const angle = Math.atan2(y - centerY, x - centerX);
    const distance = Math.hypot(x - centerX, y - centerY);
    
    if (distance < this.centerRadius) {
      return { zone: 'center' };
    }
    
    const sector = this.angleToSector(angle);
    
    if (this.isCardinal(sector)) {
      return { zone: 'cardinal', direction: sector };
    } else {
      return this.gridHitTest(sector, x, y);
    }
  }
}
```

### Mapping to Game Elements

| Zone | Maps To |
|------|---------|
| **N/S/E/W** | Room exits, major verbs |
| **NE grid** | Inventory items |
| **NW grid** | Actions on current object |
| **SE grid** | Dialog options |
| **SW grid** | Party members / targets |
| **Center** | Cancel / Self / Examine |

### Dynamic Quadrant Content

```javascript
pieMenu.quadrants.NE = world.player.inventory;
pieMenu.quadrants.NW = world.room.advertisements;
pieMenu.quadrants.SE = world.npc?.dialogOptions;
pieMenu.quadrants.SW = world.party.members;
// Each renders as ceil(sqrt(n)) grid!
```

### The Circle-Square Duality

```
CIRCULAR:              SQUARE:
- Cardinal arcs        - Grid quadrants
- Center zone          - Row/column items
- Muscle memory        - Predictable positions
```

### File Structure

```
skills/adventure/runtime/js/
  ├── engine.js      # Main runtime
  ├── pie-menu.js    # THE HYBRID PIE MENU!
  ├── world.js       # Context object
  └── render.js      # Display layer
```

### Why JavaScript Only

**DON:** "Don't need Python version."

- Pie menus are **UI-only** — browser interaction
- Python = truth, JS = presentation
- Keep the boundary clean

**"The pie menu is the face of the world."**

## 53. Quality-Based Cooking — Skill × Tools × Ingredients!

<details>
<summary><strong>Cooking skill generates food with quality that modifies buffs</strong></summary>

*Don thinks about food production.*

**DON HOPKINS:** "Players with cooking skills generate food with quality based on their skill, appliances, ingredients... and that quality factors into the buffs!"

### The Quality Formula

```javascript
food.quality = combine(
  player.skills.cooking,           // Your skill level (0-100)
  appliance.quality,               // Stove quality (0-100)
  tools.quality,                   // Knife, pan quality
  ingredients.averageQuality,      // Fresh vs stale
  recipe.difficulty,               // Complex recipes need more skill
  random.luck                      // A bit of chaos!
);
```

### Quality Tiers

| Quality | Name | Buff Modifier |
|---------|------|---------------|
| 0-20 | Terrible | ×0.5, add food-poisoning chance |
| 21-40 | Poor | ×0.75 |
| 41-60 | Decent | ×1.0 (baseline) |
| 61-80 | Good | ×1.25 |
| 81-95 | Excellent | ×1.5 |
| 96-100 | Masterpiece | ×2.0, add bonus buff! |

### Food Object with Quality

```yaml
object:
  id: homemade-stew
  name: "Homemade Stew"
  tags: ["food", "cooked", "comfort"]
  
  # Quality affects everything!
  quality: 78                    # Good stew!
  quality_name: "Good"
  
  # Who made it and how
  provenance:
    cook: characters/don-hopkins/
    skill_used: 65
    appliance: kitchen/stove.yml
    ingredients:
      - { item: mystery-meat, quality: 40 }
      - { item: fresh-vegetables, quality: 90 }
      - { item: secret-spices, quality: 100 }
    
  # Base nutrition (modified by quality)
  nutrition:
    energy: 60           # × quality_modifier
    comfort: 40
    
  on_consume: |
    Apply nutrition × quality_modifier
    If quality >= 96: add "Chef's Kiss" bonus buff
    If quality <= 20: 30% chance of food poisoning
```

### Quality Modifying Buffs

```yaml
# Base coffee buff
buff:
  id: coffee-buzz
  effect: "+20% speed"           # Base effect
  
# When consumed, quality modifies:
on_consume: |
  speed_bonus = 20 * food.quality_modifier
  # Excellent coffee (quality 85): +30% speed!
  # Terrible coffee (quality 15): +10% speed
```

### Food Coloring Magic!

**DON:** "Add food coloring and the buffs take that color into account!"

```yaml
object:
  id: rainbow-cupcake
  tags: ["food", "magical", "colorful"]
  
  colors:
    - red      # Fire element
    - blue     # Water element  
    - green    # Nature element
    
  on_consume: |
    For each color:
      red: add fire-resistance +10%
      blue: add ice-resistance +10%
      green: add poison-resistance +10%
      yellow: add lightning-resistance +10%
      purple: add psychic-resistance +10%
      orange: add energy +5
      pink: add charm +5
      black: add stealth +10%
      white: add purity (cleanse 1 debuff)
```

### Color-Coded Potions

```yaml
# The color IS the effect!
potion:
  id: mystery-potion
  color: "swirling purple and gold"
  
  # LLM interprets color semantically!
  on_consume: |
    Purple = psychic/magical
    Gold = luck/fortune
    Swirling = unstable/random
    
    Apply: random magical buff with luck bonus
```

### The Cooking Minigame

```yaml
cooking_event:
  recipe: "El Diablo Burrito"
  difficulty: 75
  
  steps:
    - { action: "chop", skill_check: 40, tool: "knife" }
    - { action: "sauté", skill_check: 60, tool: "pan" }
    - { action: "spice", skill_check: 80, ingredients: ["ghost-pepper"] }
    - { action: "fold", skill_check: 50, tool: null }
    
  # Each step contributes to quality
  # Failures reduce quality but don't necessarily fail the dish
  quality_formula: |
    sum of (step.success_degree * step.weight) / total_weight
    + cook.skill * 0.2
    + ingredient.average_quality * 0.3
    + appliance.bonus * 0.1
```

### Ingredient Quality Decay

```yaml
# Ingredients decay over time!
object:
  id: fresh-fish
  tags: ["food", "ingredient", "perishable"]
  
  quality: 95          # Just caught!
  
  simulate: |
    Each turn:
      If not refrigerated:
        quality -= 5
      If refrigerated:
        quality -= 1
      If quality < 20:
        rename to "Suspicious Fish"
        add tag "dangerous"
      If quality <= 0:
        transform to "Rotten Fish"
        only useful as grue bait
```

### The Sims Connection

| Sims Cooking | MOOLLM Cooking |
|--------------|----------------|
| Cooking skill | `player.skills.cooking` |
| Appliance quality | `appliance.quality` |
| Ingredient freshness | `ingredient.quality` decay |
| Meal quality | `food.quality` computed |
| Moodlets from food | Quality-modified buffs |
| Fire hazard | Low skill + bad stove = EVENT! |

**"You don't just EAT the food. You experience its QUALITY."**

### Coffee Stacking — No Free Pee!

**DON:** "More coffee cancels the scheduled crash, adds more buzz time, just adds to the pee. No free lunch or free pee!"

```yaml
# Coffee consumption stacking rules
on_consume_coffee:
  
  # Check if already caffeinated
  if i_have_buff("coffee-buzz"):
    
    # CANCEL the scheduled crash!
    cancel_scheduled_buff("caffeine-crash")
    emit "The crash retreats... for now."
    
    # EXTEND the buzz duration
    extend_buff("coffee-buzz", duration: 5)
    emit "You feel the buzz intensify!"
    
    # BUT... the pee just STACKS
    # No canceling this one!
    if i_have_buff("need-to-pee"):
      # Make it worse
      modify_buff("need-to-pee", {
        pressure: +20,
        urgency: +1
      })
      emit "Your bladder protests."
    else:
      # First coffee's pee effect
      schedule_buff("need-to-pee", delay: 3)
      
  else:
    # First coffee of the day
    apply_buff("coffee-buzz", duration: 5)
    schedule_buff("caffeine-crash", delay: 6)
    schedule_buff("need-to-pee", delay: 3)
```

### The Coffee Debt Visualized

```
Cup 1: ☕
  Buzz: ████████ (5 turns)
  Crash: scheduled for turn 6
  Pee: scheduled for turn 3

Cup 2 at turn 2: ☕☕
  Buzz: ████████████ (extended to turn 7!)
  Crash: CANCELLED, rescheduled for turn 8
  Pee: ████░░░░ (turn 3 + extra pressure!)

Cup 3 at turn 4: ☕☕☕
  Buzz: ████████████████ (extended to turn 9!)
  Crash: CANCELLED AGAIN, turn 10
  Pee: ████████████ (CRITICAL! Find bathroom!)

Finally crash at turn 10: 💀
  All that borrowed energy comes due
  Pee: still there, now URGENT
```

### The No Free Pee Rule

```javascript
// Coffee stacking logic
function consumeCoffee(world) {
  const buzz = world.player.buffs.find(b => b.id === 'coffee-buzz');
  const crash = world.player.scheduled.find(b => b.id === 'caffeine-crash');
  const pee = world.player.buffs.find(b => b.id === 'need-to-pee');
  
  if (buzz) {
    // Extend the good
    buzz.remaining += 5;
    
    // Cancel the bad (for now)
    if (crash) {
      crash.delay += 5;  // Push it back
    }
    
    // But the pee? ALWAYS ACCUMULATES
    if (pee) {
      pee.pressure += 20;  // No escape!
    } else {
      scheduleBuffaddBuff('need-to-pee', { delay: 3, pressure: 20 });
    }
  } else {
    // Fresh start
    applyBuff('coffee-buzz', { duration: 5 });
    scheduleBuff('caffeine-crash', { delay: 6 });
    scheduleBuff('need-to-pee', { delay: 3, pressure: 20 });
  }
  
  world.emit("The coffee warms your soul.");
}
```

### Why This Matters

| Buff | Stackable? | Behavior |
|------|------------|----------|
| coffee-buzz | Extends | Duration adds |
| caffeine-crash | Postpones | Pushed back, never cancelled |
| need-to-pee | ACCUMULATES | Pressure always increases! |

**"You can borrow energy from the future. You cannot borrow bladder capacity."**
