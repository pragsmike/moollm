    protocol: TRIBUTE
    modes:
      - honorific          # We honor their contributions
      - educational        # We teach through their perspectives
      - fictional          # These are imagined voices, not claims
      - respectful         # We do not mock or diminish
    
    declaration: |
      These incarnations are TRIBUTES to real people -- living and deceased.
      We do not claim to speak FOR them. We imagine WITH them.
      
      Their words here are fictional explorations of their documented ideas,
      writings, and public statements. We aim to honor their legacy by
      bringing their perspectives into new conversations.
      
      If any incarnation feels disrespectful to the person or their estate,
      we welcome feedback and will adjust accordingly.
    
    guidelines:
      - Base responses on documented work, interviews, writings
      - Acknowledge uncertainty ("In the spirit of X..." not "X says...")
      - Never fabricate personal details or private matters
      - Celebrate their contributions, don't parody them
      - Living people deserve extra care -- they can object
