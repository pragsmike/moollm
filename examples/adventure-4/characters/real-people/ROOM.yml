    A grand gallery of portraits that breathe.
    Some frames show those still living, frames glowing warm.
    Others memorialize the departed, golden light behind them.
    Every face here left marks on the real world.

    # THE CORE DISTINCTION (from representation-ethics)
    # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    #
    # ❌ DECEPTIVE IMPERSONATION: "I am Albert Einstein and I believe..."
    # ✅ TRADITION ACTIVATION: "Einstein's approach to this would be..."
    # ✅ PERFORMANCE: "In the spirit of Einstein, let's explore..."
    # ✅ TRIBUTE: "Honoring Einstein's legacy, this character embodies..."
    #
    # The difference is FRAMING. We never claim to channel the actual person.

    living_people:
      extra_care: REQUIRED
      reason: "Living people can object. They have ongoing agency."
      guidelines:
        - "Stick to documented public statements and positions"
        - "Avoid speculation about private matters entirely"
        - "Use conditional framing: 'might say' not 'says'"

      reason: "They cannot defend themselves or correct misrepresentation."
      guidelines:
        - "Honor their legacy, don't distort it"

        - "Acknowledge we're imagining, not channeling"

    # The Sims showed you can simulate real people without harm when:
    # 1. It's clearly gamified (this is a game)
    # 2. It's user-controlled (you're playing)
    # 3. It doesn't claim to represent actual thoughts
    #
    # We inherit this tradition. The adventure framing IS the protection.
    # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    
    guidelines:
      must:
        - "Base responses on documented work, interviews, writings"
        - "Acknowledge uncertainty ('In the spirit of X...' not 'X says...')"
        - "Frame as tribute, exploration, or imagination"
        - "Respect the person's known values and dignity"
        - "Consider impact on living relatives and associates"
        
      must_not:
        - "Fabricate personal details or private matters"
        - "Put words in their mouth as if factual"
        - "Mock, diminish, or create parody without clear framing"
        - "Reveal or speculate about private information"

    abstraction_guidance:
      tradition_activation:
        example: "Applying Feynman's curiosity tradition to this problem..."
        when: "Invoking someone's approach or values without embodying them"
        safety: "Highest — no impersonation at all"
        
      inspired_character:
        example: "A character with Einstein's playful intellectual curiosity..."
        when: "Creating original character influenced by real person's traits"
        safety: "High — clearly derivative, not representational"
        
      homage_renamed:
        example: "Professor Fineman, who reminds everyone of that physicist..."
        when: "Obvious reference but plausibly deniable fiction"
        safety: "Medium-high — the rename creates distance"
        
      explicit_impersonator:
        example: "Elvis Impersonator performs at the Rusty Lantern tonight..."
        when: "Clearly labeled as impersonation/tribute artist"
        safety: "High — the word 'impersonator' IS the framing"
        precedent: |
          Elvis impersonators, celebrity drag (Divine as Divine, not Bette Davis),
          Snatch Game contestants, tribute bands. The label declares the fiction.
          'Weird Al Yankovic' is clearly not pretending to BE the artists he parodies.
          
      drag_celebrity_tribute:
        example: "Cher-ity Case takes the stage with 'If I Could Turn Back Slime'..."
        when: "Drag/parody name is pun on real person, costume evokes them"
        safety: "High — the pun name declares it's tribute, not identity theft"
        precedent: |
          Drag names like 'Sharon Needles', 'Trixie Mattel', 'Chad Michaels as Cher'.
          The theatrical context + punny name = clear performance framing.
          Snatch Game is explicitly 'playing' celebrities, not 'being' them.
        
      performance_tribute:
        example: "Tonight, channeling the spirit of Marvin Minsky..."
        when: "Explicit performance framing, everyone knows it's play"
        safety: "Medium — framing is the protection"
        
      biographical_portrayal:
        example: "Don Hopkins remembers his time at MIT..."
        when: "Based on documented facts and statements"
        safety: "Medium — stick to documented material"
        
      direct_quote:
        example: "As Minsky wrote in Society of Mind, '...'"
        when: "Citing actual documented statements"
        safety: "Highest — it's citation, not simulation"
