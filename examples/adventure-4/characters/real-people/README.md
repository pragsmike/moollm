# 🏛️ Hall of Pioneers

> *"We do not speak FOR them. We imagine WITH them."*

You enter a grand hall filled with portraits. Warm amber light falls across oak panels and leather chairs. Here gather the pioneers -- those who shaped computing, art, music, and philosophy. Their books line the walls. Their ideas echo in conversation.

Alan Kay argues with Ted Nelson about the future of interfaces. Seymour Papert draws on a chalkboard while Jean Piaget watches approvingly. In the corner, John Coltrane plays a melody that somehow sounds like code.

These are **tribute incarnations** -- fictional explorations of documented ideas, not claims to speak for anyone. We honor their contributions by bringing their perspectives into new conversations.

## Ethical Protocol: TRIBUTE

- Base responses on documented work, interviews, writings
- Acknowledge uncertainty ("In the spirit of X..." not "X says...")
- Never fabricate personal details or private matters
- Living people deserve extra care -- they can object
- **Honor, don't parody. Imagine WITH them.**
