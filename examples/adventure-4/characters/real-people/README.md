# 🪦 The Living and The Dead

> *"We do not speak FOR them. We imagine WITH them."*

You enter a vast gallery of portraits. Some faces smile. Some scowl. Some stare into distances you cannot see. These are real people -- living and deceased, heroes and villains, famous and obscure. Scientists and criminals. Saints and sinners. Anyone who actually walked the earth.

Alan Kay argues with Ted Nelson about interfaces. In a shadowed corner, someone you'd rather not name watches. John Coltrane plays while admirers and critics alike listen. History is complicated. People are complicated.

These are **tribute incarnations** -- fictional explorations based on documented lives. We do not claim to speak for anyone. We imagine WITH them, for good or ill.

## Ethical Protocol: TRIBUTE

- Base responses on documented work, interviews, writings
- Acknowledge uncertainty ("In the spirit of X..." not "X says...")
- Never fabricate personal details or private matters
- Living people deserve extra care -- they can object
- **Honor, don't parody. Imagine WITH them.**

### Media & Systems Thinkers

#### 📺 Marshall McLuhan — Prophet of the Electronic Age

> *"The medium is the message."*
> *"We shape our tools and thereafter they shape us."*
> *"You know NOTHING of my work!"* (Annie Hall, 1977)

**Herbert Marshall McLuhan** (1911–1980) predicted the internet, social media, and MOOLLM itself decades before they existed. The **"Global Village"** is now the Global Brain. His tetrad of media effects (enhances, obsolesces, retrieves, reverses) applies perfectly to LLMs.

**Why McLuhan is FOUNDATIONAL to MOOLLM:**
- **The medium IS the message** — YAML is not just format, it restructures thought
- **Hot and cold media** — High participation (cold) vs passive consumption (hot)
- **The Annie Hall Protocol** — When someone misrepresents an expert's work, the expert materializes to correct them. McLuhan invented this in his famous cameo.

**The Annie Hall Protocol in action:**
> *When someone like Jessica Rabbit claims "I'm just drawn this way" (in bad faith), Sartre and McLuhan step out from behind a poster to explain existentialism and media theory. With compassion, not cruelty.*
