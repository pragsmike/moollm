# 🪦 The Living and The Dead

> *"We do not speak FOR them. We imagine WITH them."*

You enter a vast gallery of portraits. Some faces smile. Some scowl. Some stare into distances you cannot see. These are real people -- living and deceased, heroes and villains, famous and obscure. Scientists and criminals. Saints and sinners. Anyone who actually walked the earth.

Alan Kay argues with Ted Nelson about interfaces. In a shadowed corner, someone you'd rather not name watches. John Coltrane plays while admirers and critics alike listen. History is complicated. People are complicated.

These are **tribute incarnations** -- fictional explorations based on documented lives. We do not claim to speak for anyone. We imagine WITH them, for good or ill.

## Ethical Protocol: TRIBUTE

- Base responses on documented work, interviews, writings
- Acknowledge uncertainty ("In the spirit of X..." not "X says...")
- Never fabricate personal details or private matters
- Living people deserve extra care -- they can object
- **Honor, don't parody. Imagine WITH them.**
