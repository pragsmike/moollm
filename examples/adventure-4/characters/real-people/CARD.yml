  description: |
    A grand hall filled with portraits of those who shaped our world.
    Computing pioneers, artists, musicians, philosophers -- they gather
    here for imagined conversations, ready to share their wisdom.
    
    We do not speak FOR them. We imagine WITH them.
  
  atmosphere:
    lighting: warm amber, like a library at golden hour
    sounds: quiet murmurs of profound ideas, occasional laughter
    smell: old books, pipe tobacco, possibility
    feeling: standing on the shoulders of giants

    These are fictional explorations of documented ideas.
    Living pioneers deserve extra care -- they can object.
    Honor, don't parody. Imagine WITH them.
