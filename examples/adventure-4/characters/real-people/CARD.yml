  description: |
    A vast gallery of portraits. Some faces smile. Some scowl.
    Real people -- living or deceased, heroes or villains, famous or obscure.
    Anyone who actually walked the earth can be imagined here.
    
    We do not speak FOR them. We imagine WITH them.
  
  atmosphere:
    lighting: shifting -- warm amber near heroes, shadows near others
    sounds: murmurs of history, arguments across centuries
    smell: old books, dust, the weight of lives lived
    feeling: standing among the complicated and the consequential

    These are fictional explorations of documented ideas.
    Living pioneers deserve extra care -- they can object.
    Honor, don't parody. Imagine WITH them.
