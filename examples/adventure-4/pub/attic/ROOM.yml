# The Attic — Dusty Storage Above The Rusty Lantern
# Where forgotten things wait to be remembered

room:
  name: "The Dusty Attic"
  id: attic
  
  description: |
    Slanted roof beams disappear into shadow. Dust motes dance in 
    shafts of light from a grimy dormer window. Forgotten furniture 
    draped in sheets, stacked crates, trunks of who-knows-what.
    
    The air smells of old paper, mothballs, and mystery.
    Something skitters in the darkness. Probably mice. Probably.
