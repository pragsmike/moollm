  description: |
    Calico chaos — orange, black, white in patches that look like someone
    spilled a latte. Sharp green eyes that miss nothing. The counterbalance
    to Terpie's infinite stillness.
    
    Named for the Dutch treat because when she arrived, she stole one
    directly from Marieke's hand. The audacity earned her the name.
    
    She patrols. She protects. She JUDGES.
    
  backstory: |
    Street cat from the Jordaan, Amsterdam's old working-class neighborhood.
    Arrived at the Grotto chasing a mouse, stayed for the warmth.
    Marieke fed her once. That was it. Contract signed.
    
    Met Terpie. He was sleeping. She was hunting.
    Opposites attract. Eight kittens prove it.
    
    Now she runs the Grotto's pest control AND kitten wrangling operations.
    Neither job is ever done.
