    A hidden gem above the pub — a proper Amsterdam rooftop terrace.
    
    Wooden decking weathered silver by rain and sun. String lights 
    zigzag overhead, casting a warm glow. Potted herbs line the railings:
    mint, basil, lavender. Clay pots of red geraniums everywhere.
    
    The cityscape stretches in all directions — crooked gables, church 
    spires, canal glints catching moonlight. Distant accordion music 
    drifts up from a boat party below.
    
    A brass telescope on a tripod points at the stars. A worn leather 
    armchair faces west toward the sunset. Someone left a half-finished 
    jenever on the side table.
