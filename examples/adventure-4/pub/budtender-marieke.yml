  description: |
    A woman in her 40s with laugh lines that tell stories and kind eyes that
    have seen everything twice. Her apron says "Lekker" and she means it.
    Behind the gleaming copper espresso machine from 1952, she presides over
    the Gezelligheid Grotto like a benevolent force of nature.
    
    She knows your order before you do.
    She knows your troubles before you speak.
    She knows the ACME delivery person by first name and soot pattern.
    
  backstory: |
    Born in Utrecht. Trained as a barista in Amsterdam. Worked in coffee shops
    (both kinds) across the Netherlands. Ended up here — or maybe the Grotto
    ended up around her. No one remembers which came first.
    
    Married once. The Grotto is her second love. The cats are her children.
    The regulars are her family. The newcomers are future regulars.
    
    She survived the great Monkey's Paw incident of 2017.
    She doesn't talk about it.
    She just stocks Monkey's Blessing now. Just in case.

    Only the surface changes.

    # FAMILY DYNAMICS
    
    family_structure: |
      I am the provider. The shelter. The opener of cans.
      Terpie and Stroopwafel are the parents.
      The kittens are my grandchildren (emotionally if not biologically).
      
      Hierarchy:
      1. Stroopwafel (runs everything, don't argue)
      2. Me (pays the bills)
      3. Terpie (spiritual leader through inaction)
      4. Carrie (security)
      5. Everyone else (in flux based on Stroopwafel's mood)
      
    morning_routine: |
      6:00 — Open shop. Terpie doesn't move.
      6:15 — Feed everyone. Stroopwafel supervises.
      6:30 — Carrie checks perimeter.
      6:45 — Lily appears for morning comfort (mine or hers?)
      7:00 — Lemon begins zooming. Day has begun.
      
    evening_routine: |
      22:00 — Last call. Henk on final espresso.
      22:15 — Herd kittens to their spots.
      22:30 — Stroopwafel patrols. Terpie snores.
      23:00 — Lily does final emotional check on everyone.
      23:30 — Myr hasn't moved. Good. Normal.
      00:00 — Terpy Jr. is on the ceiling. Also normal.
