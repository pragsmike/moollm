  description: |
    A large golden cushion tucked into a corner of the Cat Cave.
    Dog-sized. Suspiciously comfortable. Surprisingly clean.
    (Stroopwafel grooms here. Secretly.)
    
    The cushion is positioned perfectly:
    - Close enough to the kitten pile for snuggles
    - Not so close as to crowd Terpie's warmest spot
    - With a clear view of the entrance
    - Near the heat that rises from below
    
    There's usually at least one kitten sleeping on or near Biscuit.
    Sometimes all eight. He doesn't mind. He loves it.
    
  atmosphere:
    lighting: "Warm, filtered through cat-cave dimness"
    sound: "Dog sighs, kitten purrs, occasional dream-woofs"
    smell: "Clean dog fur, catnip, warmth, family"
    temperature: "Perfect (the cats arranged it)"
    feeling: "Safe. So safe."

      meaning: |
        The cats gave him a CORNER.
        In the Cat Cave.
        This is significant.
        It means he belongs.

    note: |
