  description: |
    Deep brown tabby, almost chocolate, with fur so soft it seems to absorb
    light. Myr has not moved quickly since birth. She's not lazy — she's
    *optimized for relaxation*.
    
    Her purr is so low and slow it's almost subsonic. Sitting near her
    makes you want to sink into the nearest cushion and never leave.
    
    She has claimed the corner pillow. No one questions this.
