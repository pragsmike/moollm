  description: |
    Multicolored chaos — calico meets tabby meets SOMETHING ELSE.
    Patches that don't make sense. Patterns that shift when you're
    not looking. Takes after both parents in the most chaotic way.
    
    Is somehow on the ceiling. No one saw how.
    
    Artists love her. She knocked over Henk's espresso once and
    he wrote his best paper. She is inspiration incarnate.
