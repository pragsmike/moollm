    Bright orange fur, almost yellow, like she's been dipped in sunshine.
    Lemon is ALWAYS moving. ALWAYS happy. Chases sunbeams. Chases shadows.
    Chases the CONCEPT of movement.
    
    You cannot be sad near Lemon. It's physically impossible.
    Her energy is contagious, her joy is weaponized.
