    Morning light streams through an east-facing window, warming 
    honey-colored floorboards. A brass bed with a patchwork quilt 
    faces the window. Above the headboard hangs a painting of 
    a rooster crowing at dawn.
    
    A small writing desk holds a guest journal and dried flowers 
    in a blue vase.
