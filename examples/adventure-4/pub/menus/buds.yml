      Mammie van der Berg (née Janssen) started growing in the '70s
      when it was decidedly less legal. She survived raids, relocations,
      and three husbands. The plants outlasted all of them.
      
      "The secret," Mammie says, "is talking to them. And never,
      ever, letting a man near the mother plants."
      
      Marieke inherited her green thumb, her patience, and her
      absolute refusal to compromise on quality.
