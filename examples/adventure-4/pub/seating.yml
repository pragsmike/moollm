    The Rusty Lantern offers three kinds of seating, each with its
    own social contract:
    
    - THE BAR: Front row. Direct bartender access. Where regulars sit.
    - THE TABLES: Open floor. Social mixing. Games and conversation.
    - THE BOOTHS: High-backed. Private. For deals and secrets.
    
    Where you choose to sit shapes who you'll meet and what you'll hear.

# THE BAR
bar_stools:

    A row of worn wooden stools lines the bar, each one shaped by

  description: |
    Scattered across the floor, scarred wooden tables of various

  "Where you sit is the first thing you say."
  — Bartender's wisdom
  
  The regulars know: bar stools are for community, tables are
  for business, booths are for secrets. Sitting in the wrong
  place sends a message. Sitting in the right place opens doors.

  - "Cheers — Norm's stool, the regulars' spots"
