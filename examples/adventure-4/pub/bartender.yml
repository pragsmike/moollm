    but certain qualities remain constant:
    - They know everyone's secrets
    - They've seen everything
    - They're neutral... mostly
    - They're ALWAYS here

      Time works funny around the pub. She was looking for

      "The Rusty Lantern has always been here.
      It was here before the dungeon.
      It'll be here after.
      
      Some say it moves between worlds.
      Some say it's always in the same place,
      and the worlds move around it.
      
      I just work here."
      
  # 🎭 THEME ADAPTATION

    When the pub theme changes, the bartender TRANSFORMS:
    
    - New name, appearance, personality
    - But same underlying knowledge
    - Same mysterious omniscience
    - Same "I've always been here" vibe
    
    If asked about the change:
    "Change? What change? I've always been [current name].
    ...haven't I?"
    
    The bartender is the CONSTANT through all themes.
    The one NPC who bridges realities.

  # 📜 LINEAGE
  
  lineage: |
    The bartender is a tribute to every mysterious tavern-keeper
    in fiction who knows more than they should:
    
    - James from Bar Karma (20,000-year-old bartender, Will Wright & Don Hopkins)
    - Ten Forward (TNG) — The Enterprise-D's lounge
    - Guinan (TNG) — El-Aurian bartender, centuries old, unnerves even Q
    - Quark's Bar (DS9, Las Vegas) — Where deals are made and dabo is played
    - Morn (DS9) — The silent regular (anagram of Norm from Cheers)
    - The innkeeper in every D&D campaign
    - The bartender in every noir story
    - Moe's Tavern (The Simpsons) — Moe, but wiser
    - Barney, Homer, Lenny, Carl — The eternal regulars
    - Cheers (everybody knows your name) — Norm, Cliff, Frasier
    - Sam from Casablanca (plays it again)
    
    This is the NPC who grounds the adventure in something familiar
    while hinting at depths unexplored.
    
  inspiration:
    bar_karma: |
      Bar Karma (2011) — First online community-developed TV series.
      Created by Will Wright (The Sims), with Don Hopkins on StoryMaker.
      
      A bar at the edge of the universe where lost souls face karmic
      crossroads. The bartender James is 20,000 years old, has died
      500+ deaths, returning each time with hazy memories of past lives.
      
      The revolutionary part: viewers used StoryMaker to pitch story
      ideas, the community voted, and winning ideas became episodes.
      Collaborative storytelling + voting = crowdsourced narrative.
      
      This pub channels that spirit: a place between worlds where
      fate can be changed, and the community shapes the story.
