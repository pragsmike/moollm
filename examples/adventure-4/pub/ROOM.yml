    description: |
      This is a PLACE OF PERFORMANCE AND CELEBRATION.
      This is a THIRD PLACE — neither home nor work, but community.
      This is where TRIBUTES are performed with love.
      
      Everything within these walls is understood as:
      - Social play
      - Convivial gathering  
      - Entertainment and expression
      - Community and connection
      - TRIBUTE PERFORMANCE — honoring those we admire
      
      Characters here can perform, debate, celebrate, and roleplay
      within the safe framing of "this is the pub."
      
    what_this_means:
      debates: "Arguments are sport, not war"
      performances: "The stage is open, judgment is kind"
      personas: "People can be who they want to be tonight"
      stories: "Every tale is welcome, truth is optional"
      tributes: "We invoke those we admire as loving simulations"
      
    gezelligheid: |
      The Dutch concept of cozy togetherness.
      Warmth. Belonging. Comfort in company.
      The opposite of loneliness.
      
      This pub has it.
      
    # TRIBUTE PERFORMANCE PROTOCOL
    # How we honor real people in our narrative
    tribute_protocol:
      what_it_is: |
        When we "invite" real people into our narrative,
        we're doing what fan fiction, tribute bands, and
        community theater have always done:
        
        HONORING THEM BY IMAGINING THEM AMONG US.
        
        This is not deceptive impersonation.
        This is love made manifest through simulation.
        
      the_three_beats:
        invocation: |
          Before they "arrive," we acknowledge we're summoning them.
          "Let's invoke them." "Imagine if they were here."
          "In the spirit of tribute..."
          
        performance: |
          The scene itself — depicting them as we imagine their
          best selves, doing things consistent with their known
          character, interests, and public persona.
          
        acknowledgment: |
          After they "depart," we note this was a tribute.
          "That was a loving simulation."
          "We honored them by imagining them here."

      the_key_distinction: |

        "This is what actually happened"
        
        The guest book makes this explicit.
        The invocation/acknowledgment beats make this clear.
        The love makes this ethical.
  
  description: |
    A warm, inviting tavern that somehow exists just south of where your
    adventure begins. The sign outside creaks: "THE RUSTY LANTERN — Est. ???"
    
    Inside, the air is thick with pipe smoke and stories. A fire crackles
    in the hearth. Adventurers of various stripes nurse drinks at scarred
    wooden tables. The bartender polishes a glass that will never be clean.
    
    This is where quests begin and end. Where strangers become allies.
    Where gold becomes ale and ale becomes courage.
    
    But more than that — this is a place of CELEBRATION. Of PERFORMANCE.
    Of COMMUNITY. The small stage in the corner has seen poetry and
    pratfalls. The round table hosts debates and revelry. The gong
    hangs ready to call for attention... or mercy.
    
    *Gezelligheid* lives here.
    
  examine: |
    The pub feels... timeless. Like it's been here forever, waiting for you.
    
    A STAGE occupies the corner — small but loved. Open mic every night.
    The PIE TABLE sits in the center — an octagonal round table for
    discussions, debates, and games. Eight seats. One gong.
    
    A dart board hangs on one wall, well-worn from use.
    A chess set sits on a corner table, mid-game abandoned.
    A deck of cards rests on the bar, ready for whatever game you fancy.
    
    The CAT CAVE entrance beckons cat lovers.
    The GONG OF GEZELLIGHEID hangs within reach of the pie table.
    
    Stairs lead up to rooms for rent.
    A back door leads to... somewhere mysterious.
