    A large stone fireplace dominates one wall, crackling warmly.
    The mantle is cluttered with curios — a ship in a bottle, a
    mysterious key, a small portrait of someone's grandmother,
    and a jar labeled "TIPS (for good service only)."
    
    The fire never seems to need tending. It's always just right.
    
  examine: |
    The stones are blackened with centuries of soot. Names and
    dates are carved into the mantle — adventurers who warmed
    themselves here before heading into darkness.
    
    A hearthstone sits at the base, worn smooth by boots.
    It has an odd symbol carved into it...

        The symbol is a teleportation rune. Speaking the activation
        word while standing on it will transport you...
        
        Where? The bartender knows. Information costs:
        - 10 gold, OR
        - A good story they haven't heard, OR
        - A favor to be named later
        
      activation: "Say HEARTHSTONE while standing on it"
      destination: "???"
      
  atmosphere: |
    The fire crackles. Sparks drift up the chimney. The warmth
    seeps into your bones after the cold of the maze. For a
    moment, everything feels safe.
    
    (But you know better than to trust that feeling.)
