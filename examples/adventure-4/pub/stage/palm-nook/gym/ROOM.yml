# PALM'S GYM
# The Infinite Climb

  You step through a doorway that shouldn't fit this much space.
  
  The Infinite Climb stretches upward forever.
  Branches spiral in impossible geometries.
  Vines hang at exactly the right distances.
  Platforms appear where you need them.
  
  Sun Wukong's gift. A jungle gym that never ends.
  
  Somewhere high above, you can hear Palm swinging.
  Or maybe that's echoes from a climb that hasn't happened yet.

    A jungle gym that extends as far as you climb.
    Never ends. Never repeats. Always interesting.
    
  features:
    procedural: |
      New sections generate as you explore.
      Difficulty scales to your ability.
      Never too easy. Never impossible.
      
    variety:
      - "Classic branches (for swinging)"
      - "Rope ladders (for climbing)"
      - "Platform islands (for resting)"
      - "Ring courses (for acrobatics)"
      - "Vine highways (for speed)"
      
    secrets: |
      If you climb in certain patterns, you find hidden rooms.
      Sun Wukong left Easter eggs throughout.
      Palm has found 3 so far:
        - A cloud observation deck
        - A room made entirely of golden peaches
        - A tiny shrine with a mirror
        
    physics: |
      Falls are always soft landings.
      You can't actually get hurt here.
      "Monkeys shouldn't fear falling," said Wukong.
