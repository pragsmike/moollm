description: |
  A jungle gym that extends as far as you climb.
  Never ends. Never repeats. Always interesting.
  
  Sun Wukong tossed something that looked like a seed.
  It sprouted instantly into an INFINITE JUNGLE GYM.
  
  "You think you were trapped?" Wukong laughed.
  "I was trapped under a MOUNTAIN for 500 years.
   Here's what I learned: the only way out is UP.
   This gym goes up forever. You'll never hit a ceiling again."

origin:
  creator: "Sun Wukong (The Monkey King)"

  philosophy: |
    For 122 years, Palm was STUCK.
    Stuck in the paw. Stuck granting wishes.
    Stuck watching others move while frozen.
    
    Wukong gave Palm MOVEMENT.
    Infinite, endless, joyful movement.
    The opposite of imprisonment.

emotional_significance: |
  Palm couldn't move for 122 years.
  Not a single swing. Not a single climb.
  Just... stuck. In a glass case. On display.
  
  Wukong understood.
  He was under a mountain for 500 years.
  He knows what it means to be FREED.
  
  "The first thing I did was JUMP," Wukong said.
  "I jumped so high I touched the pillars of heaven.
   Now YOU jump. Forever. As high as you want."
  
  Palm climbs every day now.
  Sometimes crying while climbing.
  It's not sad crying. It's "I CAN MOVE" crying.
  It's liberation tears.
