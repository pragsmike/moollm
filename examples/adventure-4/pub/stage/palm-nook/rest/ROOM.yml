# PALM'S REST SPACE
# Where peace lives

room:
  name: "Palm's Rest"
  owner: "Palm"
  type: "sanctuary"
  
description: |
  The softest room you've ever entered.
  
  A hand-woven Dutch hammock hangs between posts,
  swaying gently even when no one's in it.
  A meditation cushion sits in a perfect bubble of silence.
  And in the warmest corner, cats are always sleeping.
  
  Light is dim here. Sounds are muffled.
  Time moves differently. Slower. Kinder.
  
  This is where Palm heals. Where Palm rests.
  After 122 years of granting twisted wishes,
  Palm finally has a place to just... be.
