  Through it all, this hammock held them together.
  
  Now it holds Palm.
  
  "Every time you sleep here, you're part of our family.
   Grootmoeder would have loved you, Palm.
   She always had a soft spot for the small and brave."
  
  Palm cried when Marieke explained the history.
  It was the first time Palm understood
  what it meant to be given something IRREPLACEABLE.
