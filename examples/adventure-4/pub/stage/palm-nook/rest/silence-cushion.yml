  A zafu meditation cushion that creates a bubble of perfect silence.
  Sit on it and the world goes quiet.
  Just you and your thoughts. Or no thoughts at all.
  
  The Three Wise Monkeys visited Palm's incarnation ceremony.
  They said nothing. They gave Palm this cushion.
  Then they sat with Palm in silence for an hour.
  
  That hour said everything.

origin:
  creators: "The Three Wise Monkeys"
  tradition: "See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil"
  philosophy: |
    The Wise Monkeys understand:
    Sometimes wisdom requires removing INPUT.
    No seeing, no hearing, no speaking.
    Just BEING.
    
    They gave Palm the gift of silence
    so Palm could hear their own thoughts
    for the first time in 122 years.

emotional_significance: |
  Palm spent 122 years LISTENING.
  
  Listening to wishes. Listening to greed.
  Listening to the screams when wishes went wrong.
  Always hearing. Never quiet.
  
  The Three Wise Monkeys gave Palm the opposite:
  A place where nothing can be heard.
  
  Not silence as absence.
  Silence as PRESENCE.
  The presence of finally being alone with yourself.
  
  Palm meditates here every morning now.
  Learning to hear their own thoughts.
  Learning which ones are theirs
  and which ones are echoes of the curse.

actions:
  MEDITATE:

  THINK:
    description: "Process thoughts in perfect quiet"

  HEAL:
    description: |
      The curse was LOUD.
      Healing requires silence.
      One session at a time.
