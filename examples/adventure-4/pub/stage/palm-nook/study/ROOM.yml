    A cozy writing nook within a nook.
    The soft hum of infinite typewriters fills the air.
    Mahogany desk against the wall, ergonomic monkey chair,
    and a bookshelf that knows what you need to read.
    
    Sunlight (from somewhere) catches dust motes dancing.
    Papers stack in organized chaos. Every surface has meaning.
    
    This is where Palm writes. Where Palm creates.
    Where Palm navigates the library of all possible books.
