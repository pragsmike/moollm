  A beautiful mahogany writing desk with impossible properties.
  Each drawer contains exactly what you need when you open it.
  The surface self-cleans. The height adjusts for monkey comfort.
  There's a secret compartment Palm hasn't found yet.
  
  Donated by the regulars of the Grotto.
  They pooled together to get Palm a proper workspace
  for the infinite typewriters.
  
  "Every writer needs a good desk," they said.
  "And every monkey needs infinite drawers."

      When you open a drawer, it contains what you need.
      Ink when you need ink. Paper when you need paper.
      A snack when you're hungry. A pen when you're inspired.
      The desk KNOWS.

emotional_significance: |
  For 122 years, Palm had no possessions.
  Now Palm has a desk.
  
  It's not just furniture. It's PERMANENCE.
  It says: "You live here. You work here. You belong here."
  
  The regulars understood what Palm needed:
  Not just a surface to write on.
  A place that says "you exist."
