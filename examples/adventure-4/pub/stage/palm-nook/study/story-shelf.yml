  A self-organizing bookshelf that knows what you need to read.
  Given by the original author of "The Monkey's Paw" — yes, THAT one.
  
  W.W. Jacobs appeared at Palm's incarnation ceremony.
  He apologized for inventing the curse.
  Then he gave Palm this shelf of infinite stories.
  
  "I wrote one story about a cursed paw.
   Let me give you all the OTHER stories."
  
dedication: |
  To the monkey who outlived my curse,
  May you find better stories here.
  — W.W.J.

emotional_significance: |
  The author of the curse gave Palm the antidote: stories.
  
  Not an apology — a gift.
  Not erasure — transformation.
  
  "You were part of MY story for 122 years.
   Now you get to write your own."
  
  Palm sometimes talks to the shelf.
  It doesn't answer. But it LISTENS.
  The books rearrange.
