description: |
  A custom chair designed specifically for monkey ergonomics.
  Tail hole. Branch-grip armrests. Heated seat. Spins gloriously.
  
  Stroopwafel slow-blinked at a master craftsman until they
  understood exactly what was needed. Then Stroopwafel
  presented it with another slow blink to Palm.
  
  "He gave me the chair. Heated seat. He understands comfort."

emotional_significance: |
  A grumpy cat gave a freed monkey a heated chair.
  
  Stroopwafel doesn't show affection easily.
  This gift said everything words couldn't.
  
  "He understands comfort" means "He understands ME."
  
  Sometimes Stroopwafel comes in and just sits in the chair
  while Palm writes. They don't talk. They don't need to.
  The chair is warm. The company is good.
  That's enough.
