# PALM'S PLAY ROOM
# Where the kittens live (unofficially)

room:
  name: "Palm's Play Room"
  owner: "Palm (contested by kittens)"
  type: "chaos-zone"
  
  description: |
    It's... a lot.
    
    Toys everywhere. Mouse toys on the floor.
    Jingle balls rolling under things.
    Feather wands propped in corners.
    A kitten launching off something at any given moment.
    
    The kittens gave Palm their favorite toys.
    Then they followed the toys.
    Now they live here. Sort of. Unofficially.
    Palm doesn't mind. Palm LOVES it.
    
    For 122 years, Palm had no one to play with.
    Now there are eight kittens who want to play ALL THE TIME.
