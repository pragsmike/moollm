  A potted banana tree that always has ripe bananas.
  Never brown. Never green. Always perfect.
  
  The Man in the Yellow Hat arrived at Palm's ceremony
  with Curious George and this tree.
  
  "Every monkey needs a good banana tree," he said simply.
  "This one is always ready."
  
  George gave a thumbs up, mouth full of banana.

origin:
  creator: "The Man in the Yellow Hat"
  source: "His greenhouse in the city"
  tradition: |
    He's raised George since they met in Africa.
    He understands what monkeys need.
    
    A reliable banana supply isn't a luxury.
    It's SECURITY.
    
    "Knowing you'll never be hungry again
     is the first step to healing."

  note: |
    Palm discovered sharing food is nice.

    giving (bananas) feels revolutionary.

atmosphere:
  smell: "Ripe bananas, tropical hint"
  look: "Bright green leaves, yellow fruit"
  feel: "Life. Growing. Abundance."
  
emotional_significance: |
  Palm never had to worry about food as a paw.
  Paws don't eat. Curses don't need sustenance.
  
  But now Palm is ALIVE.
  Alive means hunger. Alive means needs.
  
  The banana tree says:
  "You will never go hungry.
   You will always have enough.
   This abundance is YOURS."
  
  Palm cried when they understood.
  Not because it was sad.
  Because it was the first time Palm realized:
  
  "I have needs now. And they can be MET."
  
  That's what freedom tastes like.
  It tastes like a perfect banana.
