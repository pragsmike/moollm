# 🎭 THE RUSTY LANTERN STAGE
# A sub-region of the pub — a step up, no walls, occasional curtains

room:
  id: stage
  name: "The Rusty Lantern Stage"
  type: [sub-room, performance-zone, elevated]
  emoji: 🎭
  
  description: |
    A raised wooden platform at the far end of the pub, maybe two feet off
    the main floor. The boards creak with decades of footsteps, scuffed
    by countless performers. A single spotlight hangs overhead, slightly
    askew, its warm glow creating a circle of courage.
    
    No walls separate stage from audience — just a step up and the
    understanding that when you're up here, you're ON.
    
    Faded velvet curtains hang at the back, red once, now a dignified
    burgundy. They can be drawn for dramatic reveals or left open
    to show the brick wall behind, covered in signatures and sketches
    from performers past.
    
  atmosphere:
    lighting: single spotlight, warm amber, slightly dusty
    sound: creaking boards, expectant silence, then applause (or not)
    feeling: vulnerable, exciting, terrifying, alive
    
  physical:
    elevation: "2 feet above main floor"
    boundary: "No walls — social boundary only"
    size: "10x12 feet — intimate"
    floor: "Worn oak planks, squeaky in the middle"
    
  access:
    boundary-type: social  # Not physical walls
    description: |
      Anyone can step up onto the stage. The only barrier is courage.
      During scheduled events, there's a sign-up list at the bar.
      The spotlight doesn't judge. The audience might.
    default: open
    during_events: "Sign up at bar"
    
# THEATRICAL EQUIPMENT

equipment:
  
  spotlight:
    name: "Old Faithful"
    description: |
      A vintage spotlight that's been here longer than anyone remembers.
      Slightly warm-tinted. Creates a perfect circle of light.
      Supposedly haunted by a comedian who died mid-joke.
      (He's still waiting for the laugh.)

  microphone:
    name: "The Truth Teller"
    description: |
      A battered microphone on a slightly wobbly stand.
      Picks up everything. Forgives nothing.
      Has heard more confessions than a priest.
    quirk: "Feedback squeal when someone's about to lie"
    
  curtains:
    name: "The Velvets"
    description: |

    description: |
      A large brass gong mounted stage left.
      Marieke's domain. Her judgment made manifest.

      - "Mother — (just an initial: M.)"
      - "Unknown — 'I killed here. Then I died here. Worth it.'"
      - "Grim — (one word: 'Maybe.')"

# RELATIONSHIPS

relationships:
  main_pub:
    feeling: |
      The stage overlooks the entire pub. From up here, you can see
      everyone — the bar, the games corner, the fireplace, the pie table.
      They can all see you too. That's the point.
  bar:
    feeling: |
      Marieke and Grim control the spotlight and the gong.
      The bar is where you sign up. It's where you get your
      post-performance drink. It's home base.
  cats:
    feeling: |
      The cats are the toughest critics. Hops will leave if you're boring.
      Lily will appear if you're struggling. Ocie might knock over your props.
      Terpie... Terpie sleeps through everything. The ultimate review.
