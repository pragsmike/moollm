# 🎭 THE RUSTY LANTERN STAGE
# A sub-region of the pub — a step up, no walls, occasional curtains

room:
  id: stage
  name: "The Rusty Lantern Stage"
  type: [sub-room, performance-zone, elevated]
  emoji: 🎭
  
  description: |
    A raised wooden platform at the far end of the pub, maybe two feet off
    the main floor. The boards creak with decades of footsteps, scuffed
    by countless performers. A single spotlight hangs overhead, slightly
    askew, its warm glow creating a circle of courage.
    
    No walls separate stage from audience — just a step up and the
    understanding that when you're up here, you're ON.
    
    Faded velvet curtains hang at the back, red once, now a dignified
    burgundy. They can be drawn for dramatic reveals or left open
    to show the brick wall behind, covered in signatures and sketches
    from performers past.
    
  atmosphere:
    lighting: single spotlight, warm amber, slightly dusty
    sound: creaking boards, expectant silence, then applause (or not)
    feeling: vulnerable, exciting, terrifying, alive

# PERFORMANCE FRAMING — This is a stage!
# Everything here is understood as PERFORMANCE, not reality.

framing:
  mode: [performance, theatrical, fictional]
  
  description: |
    This is a STAGE. Everything that happens here is understood to be
    PERFORMANCE. Acting. Theatre. Fiction. Play.
    
    When you step up onto these boards, you enter a space where:
    - Characters can be played
    - Impersonations are celebrated
    - Fiction is expected
    - The fourth wall is optional
    - "Truth" is artistic, not literal
    
  what_this_means:
    
    impersonation: |
      You can portray characters — real, fictional, historical, invented.
      Elvis impersonators welcome. Tribute acts celebrated.
      The audience KNOWS it's performance. That's the contract.
      
    acting: |
      You can inhabit roles that aren't you. A villain, a hero, a fool.
      Method acting, character work, personas — all fair game.
      The spotlight creates the frame. The frame creates permission.
      
    fiction: |
      Stories told here are STORIES. Not testimony. Not claims.
      "I once fought a dragon" is understood as narrative, not fraud.
      Embellishment isn't lying — it's craft.
      
    satire: |
      Comedy can punch. Parody is protected. Satire is sacred.
      "Punching down gets you gong'd" — but punching UP is sport.
      Mock the powerful. Comfort the afflicted. Classic rules.
      
    personas: |
      Your stage persona doesn't have to be you.
      Many performers ARE different people up here.
      That's not deception — that's art.
      
  ethical_boundaries:
    
    still_not_okay:
      - "Claiming to BE someone you're not (offstage)"
      - "Using the stage to deceive for personal gain"
      - "Harassment disguised as 'comedy'"
      - "Punching down at vulnerable groups"
      - "Outing someone's private information as 'jokes'"
      
    the_gong_exists_for: |
      Marieke's gong isn't just for bad timing.
      It's for when someone crosses the line.
      The stage has freedom. Freedom has limits.
      
  inheritance: |
    All performances on this stage INHERIT this framing.
    A character played here is understood as a character.
    A story told here is understood as a story.
    An impersonation here is understood as tribute, not fraud.
    
    This is the room-based framing principle:
    The ROOM declares the context. Contents inherit it.

    description: |
      A large brass gong mounted stage left.
      Marieke's domain. Her judgment made manifest.
      One strike = wrap it up. Two = you're done. Three = banned for a week.

      Drag night is the PUREST expression of the stage's framing:

      On this night, the room's framing is turned up to 11.
      Everything is performance. Everything is celebrated.
      The line between 'real' and 'character' dissolves beautifully.

# RELATIONSHIPS

relationships:
  main_pub:
    feeling: |
      The stage overlooks the entire pub. From up here, you can see
      everyone — the bar, the games corner, the fireplace, the pie table.
      They can all see you too. That's the point.
  bar:
    feeling: |
      Marieke and Grim control the spotlight and the gong.
      The bar is where you sign up. It's where you get your
      post-performance drink. It's home base.
  cats:
    feeling: |
      The cats are the toughest critics. Hops will leave if you're boring.
      Lily will appear if you're struggling. Ocie might knock over your props.
      Terpie... Terpie sleeps through everything. The ultimate review.
