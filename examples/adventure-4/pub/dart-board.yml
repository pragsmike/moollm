  description: |
    A well-worn dart board hangs on the wall, its surface scarred
    by thousands of throws. The bullseye is discolored from use.
    A set of brass darts sits in a holder beneath it.
    
    Initials are carved into the wooden frame — past champions
    and notorious losers immortalized in oak.
    
  examine: |
    Some carved initials: "WEC — 247" (Wile E. Coyote, presumably),
    "SA '78" (Scott Adams tribute), "WC + DW" (who knows).
    
    The house rules are posted:
    - Standard 501, double out
    - Loser buys drinks
    - No throwing at other patrons
    - ACME products prohibited
