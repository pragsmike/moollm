    The original. The ancestor. A Pong cabinet from 1972, still working
    after all these years. Two paddles, one ball, infinite possibilities.
    
    The screen flickers with that beautiful monochrome simplicity.
    "AVOID MISSING BALL FOR HIGH SCORE"
    
  examine: |
    The cabinet is battered but beloved. Cigarette burns from an era
    when you could smoke in bars. Coffee rings. A generations of
    quarter slots worn smooth.
    
    A brass plaque reads: "First arcade game installed at Andy Capp's
    Tavern, Sunnyvale, CA, 1972. This unit: serial #0042."
    
    The original instructions are still legible:
    "DEPOSIT QUARTER. BALL WILL SERVE AUTOMATICALLY.
     AVOID MISSING BALL FOR HIGH SCORE."

    note: |
      Pong is a conversation. A negotiation.
      The ball is the question. The paddles are the answers.
      Every game tells a story.
      
  lore: |
    The bartender claims this is THE original prototype.
    The one that was so popular at Andy Capp's Tavern that
    it broke from too many quarters.
    
    Some nights, when only one player is at the cabinet,
    the other paddle moves on its own.
    
  inspiration:
    - "Pong (Atari, 1972) — Allan Alcorn, Nolan Bushnell"
    - "First commercially successful video game"
    - "Andy Capp's Tavern, Sunnyvale — where it all began"
    - "The quarter that launched an industry"
