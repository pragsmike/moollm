  description: |
    A classic Pac-Man arcade cabinet stands in the corner, its screen
    glowing with that distinctive yellow maze. The joystick is worn
    smooth from decades of frantic ghost-dodging.
    
    Someone has taped a high score sheet to the side. The top score
    is simply listed as "???" with an impossible number.
    
  examine: |
    The cabinet hums with nostalgic 8-bit energy. The side art shows
    Pac-Man being chased by Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde.
    
    A small plaque reads: "Donated by Toru Iwatani, 1980"
    
    Current high scores:
    1. ???     - 3,333,360 (perfect game)
    2. BRT     - 999,990
    3. MOM     - 847,230
    4. ACE     - 512,100
    5. YOU     - ???

  lore: |
    They say the perfect game was achieved by a ghost.
    Not Blinky, Pinky, Inky, or Clyde — a real ghost.
    An adventurer who died in the maze but couldn't let go.
    
    On quiet nights, you can hear the cabinet playing itself.
    Wakka wakka wakka...
