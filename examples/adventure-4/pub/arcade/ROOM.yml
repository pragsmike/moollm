    How did these get here? When did they arrive?
    Nobody remembers. They've always been here.
    
    A cluster of glowing cabinets hums in the corner,
    their screens casting colorful light on eager faces.
    The machines accept copper coins — somehow.
    They dispense joy — reliably.
    
    The fruit machine promises fortune.
    The pinball machine demands skill.
    The video games offer escape.
    
    This is the Arcade. It shouldn't exist.
    But it does, and everyone's grateful.
    
  atmosphere:
    lighting: neon glow, screen flicker, magical
    sound: beeps, bloops, mechanical whirring, victory jingles
    smell: ozone, old circuits, spilled ale
    feeling: nostalgic, competitive, slightly addictive
    
  # THE MYSTERY
  lore:
    origin: |
      No one installed these machines. 
      No one maintains them.
      They never break (except dramatically, for story).
      They accept any coin (copper works fine).
      
      The bartender says they've "always been there."
      The regulars nod. No one questions it.
      
      Some say a wizard was involved.
      Some say they fell through from another world.
      Some say the pub WANTED them, so they appeared.
      
    rules:
      - "Insert coin to play"
      - "High scores persist (somehow)"
      - "Winners get bragging rights"
      - "The fruit machine is NOT rigged (yes it is)"

# DESIGN NOTES
#
# The arcade is ANACHRONISTIC on purpose.
# It represents:
#   - The pub's ability to be ANY theme
#   - Nostalgia as a universal language
#   - Games as social glue
#   - Magic explaining the unexplainable
#
# When the pub THEMEs to cyberpunk, the arcade fits.
# When it's fantasy, the arcade is "wizard magic."
# It ALWAYS belongs, even when it shouldn't.
