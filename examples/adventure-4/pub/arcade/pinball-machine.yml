    A magnificent pinball machine dominates one corner, its backglass
    depicting a cosmic bar at the edge of the universe. The playfield
    is a maze of bumpers, ramps, and multiball madness.
    
    The machine is called "BAR KARMA" — custom built, one of a kind.
    The flippers are worn. The tilt sensor is generous. The high
    scores are legendary.

      The machine goes dark. A single spotlight on the ball.
      You face a choice: three shots, three outcomes.
      
      LEFT RAMP: Accept your fate
      CENTER RAMP: Change your past
      RIGHT RAMP: Transcend karma entirely
      
      No one knows what happens if you make all three shots.
      The machine has never revealed it.
      
  lore: |
    The pinball machine was built by a mad inventor who visited
    the bar seeking answers about his life. Instead of answers,
    he found purpose: to build a machine that asks the questions.
    
    They say if you achieve Wizard Mode and make all three shots,
    the machine grants you a vision of your true destiny.
    
    No one has ever done it. The bartender smiles when asked.
