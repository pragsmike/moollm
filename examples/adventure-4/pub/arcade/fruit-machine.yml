  description: |
    A classic one-armed bandit stands by the bar, chrome gleaming,
    cherries and lemons and lucky 7s spinning on its reels. The
    lever is worn smooth from a million hopeful pulls.
    
    A small sign reads: "FOR AMUSEMENT ONLY"
    (The bartender winks when you read it.)
    
  examine: |
    The machine is a beautiful piece of gambling history:
    - Three spinning reels
    - Cherries, lemons, oranges, plums, bells, bars, and 7s
    - A satisfying mechanical CLUNK when you pull the arm
    - That dopamine-triggering jingle when you win
    
    Someone has scratched "NEVER GIVE UP" into the chrome.
    Someone else has scratched "YES DO" underneath.
    
  symbols:
    cherry: "🍒 — Small win"

        - Three bells: 10 gold
        - Three bars: 25 gold
        - Three 7s: JACKPOT (100 gold!)

    KICK:

      effect: |
        The machine rattles. A single gold coin falls out.
        "That's your ONE," says the bartender. "Don't push it."

        The odds are... unclear. Some say the machine is fair.
        Some say it reads your karma. Some say it's alive.
        The bartender says nothing. The bartender always says nothing
        about the fruit machine.

      effect: "Results may vary. The machine has opinions."
      
  jackpot:
    current: "??? gold"
    note: |
      The jackpot counter has been stuck on "???" for years.
      No one knows what it means. No one has ever hit it.
      Or maybe someone did, and they're not talking.
      
  lore: |
    The fruit machine predates the bar. It was here when James
    arrived 20,000 years ago. It will be here when he leaves.
    
    Some say it's a test. Some say it's a trap. Some say
    it's the only truly random thing in a deterministic universe.
    
    The cherries know the truth. They're not telling.
