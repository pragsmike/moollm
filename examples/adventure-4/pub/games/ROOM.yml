    A corner of the pub dedicated to games of skill and chance.
    
    A dart board hangs on the wall, its surface a map of
    past victories and embarrassments. A chess table sits
    by the window, eternally mid-game. A worn deck of cards
    waits on a round table, ready for whatever game you fancy.
    
    The light here is good for concentration.
    The company is good for distraction.
    
  atmosphere:
    lighting: focused, good for seeing cards
    sound: click of chess pieces, thunk of darts, shuffling
    feeling: competitive but friendly, focused
    stakes: "Usually drinks, sometimes pride, rarely gold"

# INTEGRATION
#
# Games can spill into the main pub:
#   - Dart misses might hit patrons
#   - Chess arguments can get loud
#   - Poker wins/losses affect mood
#
# The Pie Table can host card games too,
# but this is the DEDICATED games space.
