  description: |
    A small corner table with a chess board inlaid into its surface.
    An abandoned game sits mid-play — white has a slight advantage,
    but black's position is not without hope.
    
    Who were the players? Why did they leave?
    The pieces wait patiently for someone to finish what was started.
    
  examine: |
    The pieces are hand-carved, worn smooth by generations of play.
    The white king has a chip on his crown. The black queen looks smug.
    
    A plaque on the table reads:
    "In this game, as in life: think seven moves ahead,
    but be ready when your opponent thinks eight."

  lore: |
    Legend says the original game was between Death and an adventurer
    who wagered their soul. Both players are long gone, but the game
    was never finished. Some say if you complete it, something happens.
    
    (No one knows if this is true. The bartender smiles when asked.)
