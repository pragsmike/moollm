  description: |
    A large cork board hangs near the entrance, covered in
    overlapping papers, notes, and notices. Some are official-
    looking, some are hastily scrawled, and some have been
    here so long they've faded to illegibility.
    
    This is where adventures begin — and where they're mourned.
    
  examine: |
    The board is a palimpsest of desperate pleas, dubious offers,
    and community information. Newer notices cover older ones,
    creating layers of history.
    
    Several categories are visible:
    - HELP WANTED (quest hooks)
    - WARNINGS (dangers in the area)
    - FOR SALE / TRADE
    - MISSING (people, pets, items)
    - COMMUNITY (events, announcements)
