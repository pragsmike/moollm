    You stand in a vast circular chamber lined floor-to-ceiling with
    costumes of every conceivable type. Racks spiral outward in
    concentric circles like a fabric tornado frozen in time. The
    air smells of mothballs, greasepaint, and infinite possibility.
    
    A full-length MIRROR stands in the center, ready to show you
    your transformation. A helpful MANNEQUIN holds a clipboard.
    
    Signs hang from the ceiling:
    
      "DESCRIBE ANY COSTUME — WE HAVE IT!"
      "ASK FOR 'RANDOM' FOR A SURPRISE!"
      "COMBINE COSTUMES! MIX AND MATCH!"
      "ADD ACCESSORIES! THE ONLY LIMIT IS YOUR IMAGINATION!"
      "YOUR WAISTCOAT WILL WAIT FOR YOU HERE."
      
    And in smaller, more mysterious letters:
    
      "THE MIRROR SEES MORE THAN YOUR CLOTHES.
       IT SEES YOUR SOUL. AND SOULS CAN BE TAILORED TOO."
    
    The exit WEST leads back to the Chamber of Commencement, from which
    you can go NORTH to the maze, or WEST to the kitchen (for food!).

        The archway back to the Chamber of Commencement. Your old
        identity awaits. Or your new one, depending on perspective.

  ambience: |
    Somewhere in the racks, a feather boa rustles. A sequin catches
    the light and winks at you. The costumes seem to whisper:
    "Wear me. WEAR ME. WEAR MEEEE."
    
    You resist. For now.

        notes: |
          The file name is YOUR name in the filesystem.
          Choose wisely. Or don't — you can always change it again.
          But you can't steal someone else's identity!
          
      - command: "CHANGE-MY-NAME [new name]"
        effect: "Changes the character name (the 'name:' field in the file)"
        example: "CHANGE-MY-NAME Captain Kira Ashford"
        
      - command: "LIST-CHARACTERS"
        effect: "Shows all character files in characters/"

            mother.yml          (NPC)
            skeleton.yml        (NPC, deceased)
            blackcape-mcgee.yml (NPC, rival)
        
    why_this_matters: |
      In MOOLLM, you ARE your file. The filesystem is the world.
      Your file name is your identity at the most fundamental level.
      When you rename your file, you're not just changing a label —
      you're declaring who you ARE in the universe.
      
      All characters live together in characters/ — that's how we
      know who is who in this world.
