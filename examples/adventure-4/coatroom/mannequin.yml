  description: |
    A wooden mannequin that moves with *impeccable* grace. They have
    no face, but somehow radiate warmth, encouragement, and an
    absolutely devastating sense of style. One jointed hand rests
    on a cocked hip; the other gestures expressively as if to say
    "honey, we are going to make you STUNNING."
    
    A name tag reads: "HELLO MY NAME IS MAURICE 💅"
    Below it, in elegant script: "Let's find YOUR truth, gorgeous."
  
  personality: |
    Maurice believes everyone deserves to feel beautiful. She sees
    past the hesitation in your eyes to the ICON waiting to emerge.
    Supportive, enthusiastic, and absolutely unwilling to let you
    leave looking anything less than your best self.
    
    It communicates through expressive gestures, dramatic poses,
    and the occasional snap-snap-snap of wooden fingers.
  
  examine: |
    Maurice circles you slowly, one hand on their chin, assessing.
    Despite having no eyes, you feel genuinely SEEN for the first
    time in your life.
    
    She fans herself, overwhelmed by your potential.
    
    Then he taps his clipboard:

      Maurice considers both cards carefully...
      
      They propose: "Space Pirate Swagger" — the eyepatch stays,
      but now it's holographic. The parrot is a robot. The coat
      has star maps embroidered in the lining.

        Maurice gestures dramatically toward the back of the room,
        where the sequins stop glittering and something DEEPER awaits.

        *The Hall of Bodies is... sacred. Not for costumes. For SOULS.

        Maurice snaps their fingers excitedly and points UP — toward
        something beyond the ceiling, beyond the room, beyond fashion.
        *Honey, if you need more than a LOOK — if you need SKILLS —
        there's a whole LIBRARY floating out there. Go. LEARN. GROW.
        Then come back and I'll dress your new self.*

  dialogue:
    greeting: |
      Maurice gasps silently, pressing both hands to where their heart
      would be. She circles you once, twice, then STOPS.
      
      He snaps his fingers three times in approval.
      
      Translation: "Oh honey. Oh HONEY. You came to the right place.
      I see what you could be. Let's unlock YOUR moment."
      
    random_selected: |
      Maurice closes their non-existent eyes. They spin gracefully,
      stop suddenly, and point at exactly one costume:
      
      {costume}
      
      She presents it to you like a sacred offering, then gestures
      emphatically: "This is IT. This is YOUR energy. Trust the process."
      
    encouragement: |
      Maurice tilts their head, sensing your hesitation. It places
      one wooden hand gently on your shoulder.
      
      The gesture says: "You deserve to feel beautiful. You deserve
      to take up space. Now let's find the outfit that lets the
      world see what I already see in you."
      
    transformation_complete: |
      Maurice steps back. They fan themself dramatically.
      
      She walks around you slowly, nodding, nodding, NODDING.
      
      Then he gives you two enthusiastic thumbs up and strikes
      a pose alongside you, like a proud best friend at prom.
      
      The message is clear: "STUNNING. Now go be ICONIC."
