    Racks spiral outward to the edges of the room and possibly
    beyond. Every costume you can imagine is here — and many you
    can't. The organization system defies comprehension but the
    mannequin seems to know where everything is.
  
  examine: |
    You browse the racks. Just a sampling of what you see:

    Roman toga, Egyptian pharaoh regalia, Renaissance doublet,
    Victorian ball gown, 1920s flapper dress, 1970s disco suit,
    Ancient Greek philosopher robes (beard included)
    
    **FANTASTICAL**
    Wizard robes (multiple colors), fairy wings and tutu,
    dragon costume (surprisingly comfortable), elf ears and
    woodland attire, superhero capes (many colors), villain
    capes (darker colors)
    
    **PROFESSIONAL**

    detective trenchcoat, doctor's coat, scientist lab coat
    (with optional goggles)

    **ABSURDIST**

    T-Rex, walking sandwich board, sentient fog (somehow),
    "concept of time" (abstract), literal pile of laundry

    A sign reads: "Don't see what you want? DESCRIBE IT!
    If you can imagine it, we can costume it!"

    - name: "The Dread Pirate Fantastipants"
      description: |
        A magnificent pirate captain costume! Tricorn hat with
        dramatic plume, long coat with brass buttons, billowing
        shirt, tall boots, and an eyepatch (optional — you can
        see out of both eyes, but it looks cool).
      accessories:
        - Decorative cutlass (foam, safety first)
        - Parrot puppet (can be worn on shoulder)
        - Treasure map (to nowhere in particular)
        
    - name: "Space Explorer Bumblewick"
      description: |
        A sleek silver spacesuit with helmet! Complete with
        mission patches from expeditions to made-up planets,
        a utility belt full of mysterious gadgets, and boots
        designed for "moon walking" (the dance, not the activity).
      accessories:
        - Bubble helmet (with tinted visor for drama)
        - Ray gun (goes "pew pew" when you pull the trigger)
        - Freeze-dried ice cream (still delicious)
        
    - name: "Victorian Gentleman Detective"
      description: |
        Bumblewick's waistcoat, but UPGRADED. Deerstalker hat,
        Inverness cape, magnifying glass, and an air of knowing
        more than everyone else in the room.
      accessories:
        - Meerschaum pipe (bubbles come out)
        - Notebook labeled "CLUES"
        - Watson (a sock puppet)
        
    - name: "Actually Just Three Corgis"
      description: |
        A convincing costume suggesting you are, in fact, three
        corgis standing on each other's shoulders wearing a
        trenchcoat. The topmost corgi wears a tiny hat.
      accessories:
        - Trenchcoat (extra long)
        - Tiny hat (for top corgi)
        - Squeaky toy (for morale)

  # How costume wearing works
  costume_effect: |
    When you WEAR a costume, your character description is rewritten:
    
    BEFORE:
    > Bumblewick Fantastipants, a reluctant adventurer in a waistcoat,
    > looking bewildered but optimistic.
    
    AFTER (pirate example):
    > Captain Bumblewick "Blackwaistcoat" Fantastipants, dread pirate of
    > the underground seas! His tricorn hat sits at a rakish angle, his
    > foam cutlass gleams in the lamplight, and his parrot puppet squawks
    > unconvincingly on his shoulder. Beneath the costume, he's still
    > slightly bewildered, but now he's bewildered WITH STYLE.
    
    The costume persists until you REMOVE COSTUME or put on a new one.
    Your waistcoat waits patiently in the coat check. It understands.
