### The Pub Has Changed

The **Rusty Lantern** is now the **Gezelligheid Grotto** — an Amsterdam-style coffeeshop with:

- 🌿 **Marieke** the budtender
- 🐱 **The Cat Cave** with 10 cats (Terpie, Stroopwafel, and the Terpene Litter)
- 🥧 **The Pie Menu Round Table** for structured debates
- 🔔 **The Gong of Gezelligheid** for attention and mercy
