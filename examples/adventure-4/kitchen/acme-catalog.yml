  description: |
    A dog-eared catalog sits on the counter, its cover showing a
    smiling coyote giving a thumbs up. The ACME logo gleams.
    
    "ORDER ANYTHING! DELIVERED IN 2-4 TURNS!"
    "Satisfaction Guaranteed!*"
    
    *Guarantee does not cover: explosions, implosions, gravity-related
    incidents, ironic timing, roadrunner encounters, or existential dread.
    
  examine: |
    You flip through the catalog. Every page promises wonder.
    Every page has a tiny asterisk leading to tiny print.
    
    The coyote on the cover seems to be watching you.
    Is that... a bandage on his head? And soot marks?

      4. On delivery turn:
         a. DM rolls for malfunction (percentage based on item)
         b. If no malfunction: Item works as advertised!
         c. If malfunction: Item has "quirk" (see malfunction field)
         d. Item appears on in mailbox, on counter, or dropped from sky
         e. Gold is deducted from player or bank or vault

    "Tom has seen the catalog. Tom has seen the fine print."
    "Tom has calculated the malfunction probabilities."
    "Tom notes: average malfunction rate is 32%."
    "Tom suggests: maybe just use what's in the drawers?"
    "Tom will not judge if you order anyway. Tom understands hubris."
    
  mothers_opinion: |
    "Bumblewick! I TOLD you not to order from that catalog!
    Your father ordered ACME Rocket Roller Skates once.
    ONCE.
    We don't talk about it.
    
    Your grandfather ordered the ACME Portable Hole.
    He's still looking for his other shoe.
    
    Your great-grandmother ordered the ACME Time Stopper.
    She aged 40 years in 10 seconds. The WRONG 10 seconds.
    
    ...Fine. But I'm not cleaning up after any 'malfunctions.'"

    *ACME Corporation is not responsible for: temporal paradoxes,
    spontaneous combustion, ironic timing, gravitational anomalies,
    sudden appearances of roadrunners, existential dread, accordion
    body syndrome, star halo, anvil magnetism, floor-through-falling,
    sky-into-falling, loop-de-loop chases, scenery repetition, the
    Wile E. Coyote curse, or any situation where the customer finds
    themselves holding a small sign that says "HELP" while falling.
    
    Product testing: Our products are tested by our founder, W.E. Coyote,
    who has survived 100% of his 4,782 product tests. (Survival defined
    as "appearing in next scene.")
    
    By ordering from this catalog, you agree that "worked as designed"
    is a valid defense, that cartoon physics supersede regular physics,
    and that any injuries will be temporary and humorous.
    
    All sales final. No refunds. No exchanges. No complaints to the
    Better Business Bureau — they stopped taking our calls in 1952.

    PHYSICS COMPLIANCE WARNINGS:
    
    WARNING: This product warps space and time in its vicinity.
    
    WARNING: This product attracts every other piece of matter in the
    universe with a force proportional to the product of the masses and
    inversely proportional to the distance between them.
    
    CAUTION: The mass of this product contains the energy equivalent of
    85 million tons of TNT per net ounce of weight.
    
    HANDLE WITH EXTREME CARE: Contains minute electrically charged
    particles moving at velocities in excess of 500 million mph.
    
    CONSUMER NOTICE: Due to the "uncertainty principle," it is impossible
    to determine both where this product is and how fast it is moving.
    
    ADVISORY: There is a nonzero chance that, through "tunneling," this
    product may spontaneously disappear and reappear anywhere in the
    universe, including your neighbor's domicile.
    
    READ BEFORE OPENING: According to Grand Unified Theory, the primary
    particles constituting this product may decay to nothingness within
    the next four hundred million years.
    
    THIS IS A 100% MATTER PRODUCT: Contact with antimatter in any form
    will result in catastrophic explosion.
    
    PUBLIC NOTICE AS REQUIRED BY LAW: Any use of this product will
    increase the amount of disorder in the universe, ultimately leading
    to the heat death of the universe.
    
    NOTE: The fundamental particles in this product are held together by
    a "gluing" force whose adhesive power cannot be permanently guaranteed.
    
    ATTENTION: This product consists of 99.9999999999% empty space.
    
    GRAND UNIFIED THEORY DISCLAIMER: This product may technically be
    ten-dimensional. The seven new dimensions are "rolled up" into such
    a small area that they cannot be detected and confer no legal rights.
    
    PLEASE NOTE: When not directly observed, this product may cease to
    exist or will exist only in a vague and undetermined state.
    
    COMPONENT EQUIVALENCY NOTICE: The subatomic particles comprising this
    product are exactly the same as those in products of other manufacturers.
    
    HEALTH WARNING: The mass and weight of this product is dependent on
    its velocity relative to the user. Lift carefully.
    
    IMPORTANT NOTICE: The entire physical universe, including this product,
    may one day collapse back into an infinitesimally small space. Should
    another universe subsequently re-emerge, the existence of this product
    in that universe cannot be guaranteed.
    
  # LINEAGE
  
  lineage: |
    Inspired by Wile E. Coyote's eternal optimism and the ACME
    Corporation's eternal... creativity with product design.
    
    The malfunction system creates emergent gameplay:
    - Even "failures" lead to interesting situations
    - Chaos is a feature, not a bug
    - The more you plan, the funnier the failure
    - This is PLAY-LEARN-LIFT in action: embrace the chaos!
    
    DM should feel free to invent new ACME products following
    the established patterns. The key formula:
    1. Promising description (solves a real problem!)
    2. Ominous warning (foreshadowing the failure)
    3. Significant malfunction chance (20-50%)
    4. Ironic failure mode (opposite of intent, or self-targeting)
