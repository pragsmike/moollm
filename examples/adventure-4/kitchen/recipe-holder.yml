# 📋 THE FANTASTIPANTS RECIPE HOLDER

  name: Recipe Card Holder
  type: container
  portable: true
  
  description: |
    A small wooden rack holds a collection of recipe cards,
    yellowed with age but still legible. Some are in Mother's
    handwriting. Others are in Grandmother's. One appears to
    be written in Klingon.
    
    A brass plate on the front reads:
    "FANTASTIPANTS FAMILY RECIPES
     Some Delicious. Some Dangerous. All Memorable."
    
  examine: |
    You flip through the cards. Each one tells a story:
    - Grease stains from successful meals
    - Burn marks from... less successful ones
    - Mother's annotations ("MORE SALT!")
    - Grandmother's warnings ("DO NOT MICROWAVE")
    - One card that seems to glow faintly

  # RECIPE DISCOVERY
  
  discovery: |
    New recipes can be discovered by:
    - Successful experiments on the counter
    - Finding recipe cards in the world
    - Learning from characters
    - Inventing through PLAY-LEARN-LIFT
    
    When you successfully COMBINE, TRANSFORM, or DECOMPOSE items,
    the counter AUTOMATICALLY creates a recipe card and files it here!
    
  # 🆕 DISCOVERED RECIPES (Auto-populated by crafting!)

  # TOM'S OPINION
  
  tom_opinion: |
    "Tom has memorized all recipes!"
    "Tom can remind you of ingredients!"
    "Tom is... concerned about the Klingon one."
    "Tom does not want to meet a grue. Tom is small and egg-shaped."
    "Tom believes in you though! Tom always believes!"
    
  # MOTHER'S NOTES
  
  mothers_notes: |
    "Bumblewick, cooking is an adventure in itself.
    
    Some recipes are straightforward. Some require creativity.
    Some require you to fight a monster with cheese.
    
    I'm not saying which kind I prefer, but I DID
    marry your father, and he once made dinner from
    a dragon and a bag of pretzels.
    
    Trust your instincts. Taste as you go.
    And please, PLEASE, clean up after yourself."
    
  # DECOMPOSITION RECIPES (Reverse Engineering!)

  # RECOMPOSITION NOTES
  
  recomposition: |
    Components can be COMBINED back together!
    
    PRACTICAL: Easy. Just reverse the recipe.
    CHEMICAL: Needs energy input (heat, electricity, hope)
    ATOMIC: Requires FUSION or FISSION (careful!)
    SUBATOMIC: Technically possible. Reality may object.
    PHILOSOPHICAL: Please don't.
    
    Some fun combinations:
    - Hydrogen + Oxygen → Water (boom, then splash)
    - Hydrogen + Hydrogen + Fusion → Helium + Light + Problem
    - Carbon + Pressure + Time → Diamond (time sold separately)
    - Quarks + Gluons → Whatever you want (results vary)
    
  # LINEAGE
  
  lineage: |
    The Klingon Victory Hors D'oeuvres recipe was created
    during Adventure 2, when Captain Ashford slew a grue
    with a sharpened wedge of blue cheese (the Gorgonzola Glaive)
    and prepared a victory feast from its remains.
    
    This recipe represents the ultimate PLAY-LEARN-LIFT:
    - PLAY: Experiment with cheese as weapon
    - LEARN: Discover grue vulnerabilities
    - LIFT: Codify into repeatable recipe
    
    The recipe card was added to the family collection
    and now inspires future adventurers to set ambitious goals.
