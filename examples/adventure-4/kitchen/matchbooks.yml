    A small stack of matchbooks held together with a rubber band.
    Each one has advertisements and mail-in offers on the cover.
    They smell faintly of sulfur and nostalgia.
    
    These aren't just fire-starters — they're OPPORTUNITIES.
    Mail them to receive stamps, brochures, and prizes!
    
  examine: |
    You flip through the matchbooks. Each one is from a different
    establishment, each with a different mail-in offer:
    
    📔 SPELUNKER TODAY — "Mail this matchbook for a FREE SUBSCRIPTION!"
    📔 ADVENTURER'S GUILD — "Join the Guild! Send this for membership info!"
    📔 LAMP OIL PREMIUM — "Quality oil since 1876!"
    📔 GRUE MUTUAL INSURANCE — "Because darkness happens."
    📔 MYSTERIOUS MATCHBOOK — No label. Just an address.
    
    Plus a few others in worse condition...

              The legendary "One Lousy Point" stamp, honoring Don Woods,
              co-creator of Adventure. In the original Zork, mailing a
              matchbook got you a real brochure with this stamp.
              
              Worth one lousy point. Priceless historically.

    "Tom wants the complete collection. Tom is OBSESSED."
    
  # LINEAGE
  
  lineage: |
    Direct tribute to Zork's legendary mail-in mechanic.
    
    In the original Zork, players could find a matchbook from
    "Spelunker Today" magazine. If mailed (in real life!), Infocom
    would send a brochure containing the "One Lousy Point Donald
    Woods Stamp" — a tribute to the co-creator of Adventure.
    
    This mechanic expands that single easter egg into a full
    collectible system, honoring all the founders of interactive
    fiction while providing actual gameplay rewards.
    
    The stamps are worth "one lousy point" each — but the history
    they represent is priceless.
