  portable: false
  
  description: |
    A brass mailbox mounted on the wall by the kitchen door, polished
    but ancient. The slot seems impossibly deep. The Fantastipants
    family crest is embossed on the front: the confused badger with
    its waffle iron, now wearing a postal cap.
    
    A faded sign reads:
    
        FANTASTIPANTS DUNGEON DELIVERY SERVICE
        "From the darkest depths to your doorstep!"
        Est. 1876 — Service Contract: Eternal
        
    A small red flag indicates outgoing mail.
    
  examine: |
    You peer into the mail slot. It goes deeper than makes sense.
    Deeper than the wall. Deeper than the HOUSE.
    
    A faint echo of sorting machinery drifts up. Somewhere, in some
    impossible postal dimension, letters are being routed.
    
    The mailbox is warm to the touch. It seems... aware of you.
    
    A schedule is posted:
    
    DELIVERY: Instantaneous (magic!)
    PICKUP: Continuous
    LOST MAIL: Returned to sender (eventually) (usually)
    
  # HOW IT WORKS
  
  service_details:
    delivery_time: "Instant (magic-assisted routing)"
    coverage: "Anywhere in the dungeon, surface world, or known multiverse"
    cost: "Free (Grandmother negotiated eternal service in 1923)"
    reliability: "98.7% (the remaining 1.3% arrives... eventually)"
    
    grandmother_story: |
      In 1923, Grandmother Fantastipants defeated the Dungeon Postal
      Union's champion in single combat (a sorting golem named HERMES-7).
      As tribute, the DPU granted the Fantastipants family eternal
      free postage, plus priority routing.
      
      Don't ask what she was doing in the postal dimension.
      Don't ask how she got there.
      She doesn't like to talk about it.

  # MAILBOX PERSONALITY
  
  personality: |
    The mailbox is SLIGHTLY SENTIENT. It has opinions.
    
    - Hums happily when accepting mail
    - Gets warm when receiving care packages
    - Shivers at letters addressed to "The Grue"
    - Glows faintly when important mail arrives
    - Occasionally makes sorting noises at night
    
    If asked directly, it responds via printed receipt:
    
    "I AM HERMES-7B, DESCENDED FROM THE GOLEM YOUR GRANDMOTHER DEFEATED.
    I BEAR NO GRUDGE. POSTAL SERVICE IS ITS OWN REWARD.
    PLEASE ENSURE ALL LETTERS ARE PROPERLY ADDRESSED.
    HAVE A NICE DAY."
    
  # DM NOTES
  
  dm_notes: |
    The postal system is a NARRATIVE LIFELINE:
    
    - Keeps player connected to Mother during scary moments
    - Allows emotional check-ins without breaking dungeon flow
    - Creates opportunities for worldbuilding (who else exists?)
    - Enables side quests (write to skeleton's family!)
    - Makes attachments meaningful (send photos home!)
    
    Mother ALWAYS replies. Quickly. With love.
    
    Other recipients reply based on plausibility:
    - Skeleton's family: Grateful, emotional
    - Historical adventurers: In-character, sometimes helpful
    - The Grue: "..." (but the letter is opened)
    - Fictional characters: Fun, noncanonical
    
    Use mail to deliver:
    - Plot hooks ("Grandfather's old notes arrived...")
    - Resources (care packages)
    - Emotional beats (proud letters)
    - World building (dungeon newsletter)
    
  # LINEAGE
  
  lineage: |
    The Dungeon Postal Service is inspired by:
    - Discworld's Postal Service (GNU Terry Pratchett)
    - The letters to Santa that NORAD tracks
    - Owl Post from Harry Potter, but without hate or black mold
    - The dream of being able to write to anyone, anywhere
    
    In adventure-2, the postal system enabled ongoing correspondence
    with Mother, Richard Bartle, and even the skeleton's family.
    Letters became a primary narrative driver.
    
    This is PLAY-LEARN-LIFT:
    - PLAY: Write whatever you want to whoever you want
    - LEARN: Discover who you want to connect with
    - LIFT: Letters create plot hooks, goals, emotional beats
