# The Kitchen

> *"Write back when you can. The dungeon post still works."*
> — Petunia Fantastipants

An exact replica of the Fantastipants family kitchen from Wobblebrook-upon-Squiggle, mysteriously recreated underground. Your emotional anchor. Your supply depot. Your connection to home.

## 🌟 START HERE

**Your first move should be:**

1. **GET LAMP** (from start room)
2. **Come to the kitchen**
3. **READ NOTE** on the table
4. **⭐ WRITE A REPLY TO MOTHER ⭐**

The reply is where your adventure becomes YOURS. Your promises become your goals. Your questions seed the story. Your voice shapes the world.

## 📜 Mother's Note

| **Love** | "The world may not always understand, but I do." |
| **Connection** | "Write back when you can." |
| **Legacy** | "A skeleton who never made it home..." |

**⭐ REPLY to Mother!** This is freeform creative writing that creates game mechanics:
- Who are you today? What's your name?
- What do you PROMISE to do or bring back?
- What questions do you want answered?
- What do you want her to know?
