    A porcelain sink containing a small pile of dishes that definitely
    weren't there when you looked a moment ago. This is one of the
    fundamental laws of kitchen physics: dishes appear spontaneously.
  
  examine: |
    The dishes stare at you accusingly. You should probably wash them.
    
    ...
    
    No, wait, you're on an ADVENTURE. The dishes can wait. They've
    waited this long. They can wait longer. That's what dishes do.
    
    (Mother's voice echoes in your head: "Those dishes won't wash
    themselves, Bumblewick!" But Mother isn't here. Is she?)

        You begin washing a dish. Then another. Then—
        
        No. NO. You are an ADVENTURER now. The dishes can WAIT.
        
        You dry your hands on your waistcoat and back away slowly.
