  lore: |
    Every adventurer needs a place to collect their memories.
    This notebook has been passed down through generations of
    heroes, each filling it with their own story before passing
    it on, blank once more, to the next.
    
    The pages remember, even when they appear empty.
    
  inspiration:
    the_sims_family_album: |
      The Sims included a Family Album for capturing screenshots
      with captions, organizing them into narrative sequences.
      Players wrote graphic novels, made movies, shared stories.
      The game became a platform for self-expression.
      
    storytelling_tools: |
      Like The Sims Exchange where players uploaded and downloaded
      entire families and stories, this notebook captures your
      adventure as a shareable, browsable narrative.
      
    clipboard_evolved: |
      More than a clipboard — a semantic snapshot stream.
      Items can be edited, minted into cards, carried in inventory,
      played in rooms, passed as parameters. The notebook IS the
      clipboard, but alive and organized.
