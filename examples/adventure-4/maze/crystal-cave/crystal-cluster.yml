# 💎 THE CENTRAL CRYSTAL CLUSTER
# It hums. It glows. It might be watching.

object:
  name: "The Central Crystal Cluster"
  type: [landmark, mysterious, beautiful]
  
  description: |
    A massive formation of interlocking crystals, rising from the
    floor like a frozen fountain of light. The largest crystal is
    easily six feet tall, a perfect hexagonal prism of pale violet.
    
    When you approach, the humming intensifies. Not unpleasant —
    more like the crystals are... acknowledging you?
    
    Ancient civilizations might have worshipped here.
    Modern adventurers just take selfies.

    TOUCH:
      effect: |
        The crystal is cool and smooth. The humming vibration
        travels up your arm. For a moment, you feel very small
        and very brief — a mayfly touching something that has
        existed for millennia.
        
        +1 Perspective (brief)
        
    LISTEN:
      effect: |
        You press your ear to the crystal. The humming resolves
        into something almost like... voices? No. Not voices.
        Harmonics. Mathematical patterns. The music of geology.
        
        You feel slightly more educated about minerals somehow.
        
    LICK:
      effect: |
        Why would you... okay, fine.
        
        It tastes like rock. Minerally. Your tongue feels weird
        for about an hour afterward.
        
        Was it worth it? Only you can answer that.

    The big shiny thing hums.
    I don't like things that hum without mouths.
    I will mark NEAR it but not ON it.
    Compromise achieved.
