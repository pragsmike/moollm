# 💎 The Crystal Cave

Where the earth remembers its dreams in mineral form.

## Description

A chamber filled with luminescent crystal formations. The crystals provide enough light to keep grues away. A massive central cluster hums with mysterious energy.

## Biscuit's Assessment

- **Marked:** A rock near entrance (NOT the crystals — Don advised against it)
- **Detected:** Recent rat activity (full tracking analysis complete)
- **Verdict:** "Pretty lights. Yes. But Don. DON. There was a RAT here."
