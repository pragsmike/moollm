    You enter a chamber that takes your breath away.
    
    Crystals. EVERYWHERE. Growing from the walls, the floor,
    the ceiling — luminescent formations that pulse with soft
    inner light. Blues, purples, pale greens. The light shifts
    and dances as you move, creating shadows that seem almost alive.
    
    The largest crystal cluster, in the center of the room, is
    taller than you. It hums faintly when you get close, a sound
    more felt than heard. Something about it feels... aware?
    
    The floor is uneven where crystals have pushed up through
    the rock. Watch your step.

  ambience: |
    The crystals pulse in slow rhythms, like a geological heartbeat.
    You can almost believe they're alive. Perhaps they are, just
    on a timescale too slow for you to perceive.
    
    Something small and fast darts between the formations.
    A rat? In a place this beautiful?

          RAT. RAT! There was a RAT here. Recently.
          The rat went... this way... no wait... this way...
          it looped around... it was confused...
          then it left through that crack.

      Pretty lights. Yes. But Don. DON.

      I know things. Nose things. The nose knows.
