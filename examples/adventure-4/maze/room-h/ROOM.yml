  # NOW GRUE SAFE — The Thing That Watches has made this room... unwelcoming to grues
  lighting: none

  # The grue will not come here. The eye unnerves even void-beasts.

    The grue approaches the threshold, drawn by darkness.
    Then it sees THE EYE. The eye that watches.
    The grue hesitates. Grues do not like being SEEN.
    The grue retreats. Even void-beasts have standards.

    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    
    This one has MUSHROOMS growing everywhere. Luminescent fungi
    that provide a faint, sickly green glow — not enough to
    light your way properly, but enough to make everything look
    deeply unsettling. Some of them pulse gently.
    
    In the center of the room, merging with the mushrooms,
    is THE THING THAT WATCHES. Aunt Petunia's Suspicious Casserole,
    transformed through Captain Ashford's digestive system, now
    pulses in perfect rhythm with the fungi. Its single EYE
    follows your every movement.
    
    Mother would say not to touch them. Mother would be right.
    But it's too late now. The watching has begun.

  ambience: |
    The mushrooms pulse in a rhythm that almost sounds like breathing.
    You try not to think about what's breathing. You fail.

      I will not mark the whispering mushroom.
      Some rooms do not need to know about me.
      This room knows enough.
