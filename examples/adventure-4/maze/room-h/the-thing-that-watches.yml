  description: |
    In the center of the room, merging with the luminescent mushrooms,
    pulses THE THING THAT WATCHES.
    
    It was once Aunt Petunia's Suspicious Casserole — a questionable
    dish from a previous adventurer's lunchbox. Transformed through
    digestion and excretion, it found the mushrooms. The mushrooms
    found it. They became... something else.
    
    A single EYE, formed from casserole and fungus, follows your
    every movement. It blinks. Slowly. Deliberately.
    
    Mother would say not to touch it. Mother would be right.
  
  # Origin story
  origin: |
    In adventure-2, Captain Ashford ate Aunt Petunia's Suspicious
    Casserole to mark a maze room. The "result" merged with the
    mushroom colony here and achieved... sentience? Awareness?
    Something.
    
    It watches now. That's what it does. That's ALL it does.
    
    But the watching is enough. Even grues won't come here.
  
  # This is why the room is grue-safe
  grue_repellent: true
  repellent_mechanism: |
    Grues fear being SEEN. They are creatures of absolute darkness,
    existing only where light cannot reach. The Eye sees in ways
    that light cannot — it sees through darkness, through shadows,
    through the void itself.
    
    The grue approaches. The Eye opens. The grue... reconsiders.

  # The eye tracks you
  behavior: |
    The Eye follows you as you move around the room.
    When you approach, it widens slightly.
    When you retreat, it narrows.
    When you speak, it... listens? Can eyes listen?
    This one seems to.

        The Eye meets your gaze. You feel... seen. Deeply seen.
        Uncomfortably seen. Seen in ways you didn't know were possible.
        
        The mushrooms pulse. The Eye blinks. Once. Twice.
        
        You look away first. Everyone looks away first.

        "Hello?" you venture.
        
        The Eye widens slightly. The mushrooms pulse faster.
        
        No response comes. But you have the distinct feeling
        that you've been... acknowledged.

        You reach toward the Eye.
        
        The mushrooms RECOIL. The Eye WIDENS. A sound emerges —
        not quite a scream, not quite a word, something between
        a warning and a memory.
        
        You snatch your hand back. Your fingers tingle.
        
        For the next hour, you can see slightly better in the dark.
        Also, your dreams will be... interesting tonight.

        You place [food] before The Thing.
        
        A tendril of mushroom extends, examines the offering,
        and slowly absorbs it.
        
        The Eye closes in what might be satisfaction.
        When it opens, it seems... warmer? Toward you?

        "The grue," you say. "Why won't it come here?"
        
        The Eye looks toward the south exit — toward room-f,
        where the grue lives. The mushrooms shudder.
        
        You understand without words: The grue fears being seen.
        And The Thing sees EVERYTHING.
        
    - action: THANK
      score: 65
      result: |
        "Thank you," you say. "For keeping them away."
        
        The Eye blinks slowly. The mushrooms glow a little brighter.
        
        You're not sure it understands gratitude. But you're not
        sure it doesn't, either.
