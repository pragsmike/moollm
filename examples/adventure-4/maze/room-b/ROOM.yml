    🎵 "It got narrated at you in the second person.
        Every time you booted up, it seemed you got another version
        of your life told to you by a status line blinking..." 🎵

  description: |
    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    
    This one has a peculiar echo. Every sound you make comes back
    to you a moment later, slightly distorted, as if the walls are
    mocking your navigational choices. "Hello?" "...ello...ello...ello..."
    "This is ridiculous." "...iculous...iculous...ICULOUS..."
    
    Passages lead in all directions. They all look the same.
    The echo makes it worse somehow.

    north:

      description: "A passage that echoes your footsteps back at you"
    south:
      destination: ../room-c/
      description: "A passage. The echo fades this way. Maybe."
    east:
      destination: ../room-a/
      description: "Wait, weren't you just... no, that can't be right"
    west:
      destination: ../room-c/
      description: "The walls here seem closer together. Probably fine."
  
  # Distinguishing feature
  feature: echo
  ambience: |
    Your breathing echoes back, slightly out of sync.
    It's like being haunted by a version of yourself that's
    always one breath behind.
    
  # BISCUIT'S MARKINGS (Session: Don's First Run)
  # THE ECHO-DOG INCIDENT
  biscuit_markings:
    date: "2026-01-06"
    marked:
      - location: "exact center of chamber"
        type: territorial
        note: "All echo-dogs will smell this. We are the same."
    the_echo_dog_incident:
      initial_bark: "*WOOF!*"
      echo_response: "*WOOF woof woof woof...*"
      biscuit_reaction: "WHO SAID THAT. WHO BARKED. WAS THAT ANOTHER DOG."
      second_bark: "*WOOF WOOF!*"
      echo_response_2: "*WOOF WOOF woof woof woof woof...*"
      spinning: true
      resolution: |
        Don explained it's an echo.
        Processing... I bark at myself? I am talking to me?
        Conclusion: I am many dogs. All of them are good.
    existential_discovery:
      revelation: "All echo-dogs are me. All of them are good dogs."
      philosophy: "We are the same. We are good dogs."
    biscuit_says: |
      I have discovered other dogs who are also me.
      They are good dogs. We marked the center together.

  # TERPY JR.'S ECHO-FRIENDS (Midnight Prowl)
  terpy_jr_incident:
    date: "2026-01-06 (late night)"
    what_happened: |
      Terpy Jr. got lost on the way home from the garden.
      Ended up in the echo chamber.
      Discovered "other cats" (his own echoes).
    
    dialogue:
      terpy_jr: "*MEOW!*"
      echo: "*meow meow meow...*"
      terpy_jr: "There are OTHER CATS here!"
      echo: "*cats here... cats here...*"
      terpy_jr: "FRIENDS!"
      echo: "*friends... friends...*"
      
    duration: "Two full turns (14-15)"
    departure: "*'Bye friends!'*"
    
    assessment: |
      Unlike Biscuit, who had an existential moment,
      Terpy Jr. just accepted the echo-cats as friends.
      No crisis. Just joy. Classic Terpy Jr.
