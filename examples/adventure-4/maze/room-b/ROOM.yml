        of your life told to you by a status line blinking..." 🎵

    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    
    This one has a peculiar echo. Every sound you make comes back
    to you a moment later, slightly distorted, as if the walls are
    mocking your navigational choices. "Hello?" "...ello...ello...ello..."
    "This is ridiculous." "...iculous...iculous...ICULOUS..."
    
    Passages lead in all directions. They all look the same.
    The echo makes it worse somehow.
  
  exits:
    north:
      destination: ../room-d/
      description: "A passage that echoes your footsteps back at you"
    south:
      destination: ../room-c/
      description: "A passage. The echo fades this way. Maybe."
    east:
      destination: ../room-a/
      description: "Wait, weren't you just... no, that can't be right"
    west:
      destination: ../room-c/
      description: "The walls here seem closer together. Probably fine."
  
  # Distinguishing feature
  feature: echo
  ambience: |
    Your breathing echoes back, slightly out of sync.
    It's like being haunted by a version of yourself that's
    always one breath behind.
