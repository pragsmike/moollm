# 🔊 Room B — The Echo Chamber

> *"You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike."*

A passage with a peculiar echo. Every sound you make comes back to you a moment later, slightly distorted. *"Hello?" "...ello...ello...ello..."*

The walls are mocking your navigational choices.

## 🎭 Feature: The Echo

Your breathing echoes back, slightly out of sync. It's like being haunted by a version of yourself that's always one breath behind.

**Note:** Two exits lead to room-c. This is intentional. Mazes are confusing.

## 👃 Smell Notes

The echo chamber amplifies smells too — descriptions of nearby odors return with emphasis.
