# 🥶 Room F — The Cold Spot

> *"You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike."*

This one is **COLD**. Supernaturally cold. The kind of cold that suggests something is drinking the heat out of the air. Something that doesn't need warmth. Something that feeds on its absence.

Your lamp flickers. Is it the cold? Or is something watching?

## ⚠️ EXTREME DANGER

- **No lighting** — Enter without a lit lamp and you WILL be eaten
- **Grue lair** — The grue considers this home
- **Oil drain: 1.5x** — Supernatural cold thickens lamp oil

---

## 💰 TREASURE!

In one corner, barely visible in the lamplight: **A PILE OF GOLD COINS!**

At least **100 of them!** Someone left a fortune here and never returned...

See [gold-pile.yml](./gold-pile.yml) for the tragic backstory.

## 🎭 Feature: The Cold Spot

The grue's lair. Your breath frosts in the air. The lamp's flame shrinks and struggles. Every shadow seems to move when you're not looking directly at it.

---

## 📜 Legend

> *Adventurers tell of a hero named Captain Ashford who once slew the grue that lived here, using a wedge of blue cheese as a weapon. They say you can still smell the cheese in the walls.*
>
> *But grues respawn. In the dark places of the world, new grues always come.*
