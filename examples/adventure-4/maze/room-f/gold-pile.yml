# A Pile of Gold
# Someone's misfortune is your fortune

object:
  name: Pile of Gold Coins
  type: treasure
  portable: true
  
  description: |
    A substantial pile of gold coins glitters in your lamp light, 
    scattered across the cold stone floor. Each coin bears the mark 
    of "ACME ADVENTURING SUPPLIES" — the same company that makes 
    the lamp vendor!
    
    Someone was VERY prepared. Someone is now VERY dead.
    
    (You count them. There are exactly 100 gold pieces. Enough to
    refill your lamp approximately one hundred times. Or buy the
    Premium Glow Juice twenty times. Or... look, it's a lot of gold.)
  
  value: 100  # gold pieces
  
  # How did it get here?
  backstory: |
    These coins belonged to the skeleton in room-i. They were exploring
    the maze, dropping coins as markers (a TERRIBLE strategy compared
    to food — coins all look alike!). When their lamp ran out in room-f,
    they tried to make it to the vendor in room-j but took a wrong turn.
    
    The cold got them. Or the grue did. Hard to tell with grues.
    
    The coins have been here ever since, slowly scattered by the
    occasional draft and whatever small creatures aren't afraid
    of the supernatural cold.

        You scoop up all 100 gold coins. Your pockets bulge 
        magnificently. You feel like a dragon. A small, 
        waistcoat-wearing dragon with excellent taste in spoons.

        "How many? You have space for all of them. Don't be weird 
        about it — no one's watching. The skeleton certainly isn't 
        going to judge you."
