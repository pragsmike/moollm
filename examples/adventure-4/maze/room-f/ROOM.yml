    It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
    
    The cold seeps into your bones first. Then you hear it breathe.
    Something vast and hungry, made of pure darkness, has found you.
    
    🎵 "So be advised, when entering the cave,
        to not go in past the first room alone,
        that glow's the only thing will save
        your carcass from a monster's toothy moan." 🎵

    (A previous adventurer slew a grue here once, with blue cheese.
    But grues respawn. They always respawn. In the dark, they wait.)

    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    
    This one is COLD. Supernaturally cold. The kind of cold that
    suggests something is drinking the heat out of the air. Something
    that doesn't need warmth. Something that feeds on its absence.
    
    Your lamp flickers. Is it the cold? Or is something watching?
    
    In one corner, barely visible in the lamplight: A PILE OF GOLD COINS!
    At least 100 of them! Someone left a fortune here and never returned...

        The coldest exit. Something pale gleams in the darkness.
        Is that... bone?
  
  ambience: |
    Your breath frosts in the air. The lamp's flame shrinks and
    struggles. Every shadow seems to move when you're not looking
    directly at it.
    
    The gold gleams, mocking you. Why would someone leave so much
    treasure in a grue's lair? Unless they had no choice...
    
  # History from adventure-2 (preserved as legend)
  legends: |
    Adventurers tell of a hero named Captain Ashford who once slew
    the grue that lived here, using a wedge of blue cheese as a weapon.
    They say you can still smell the cheese in the walls.
    
    But grues respawn. In the dark places of the world, new grues
    always come. This one is young and hungry.
    
    Will you be its first meal? Or its last?
