    You emerge into impossible beauty.
    
    A garden. An actual GARDEN, here in the depths of the maze.
    
    Somehow, a shaft in the ceiling opens to the sky far above,
    sending a column of genuine sunlight down into this chamber.
    The light pools on the floor like liquid gold, nurturing a
    circle of impossible green.
    
    Grass grows here — real grass, soft and slightly damp.
    Flowering vines climb the walls. A small fountain burbles
    in the center, fed by an underground spring.
    
    Benches carved from natural rock invite you to rest.
    Butterflies — BUTTERFLIES! — drift between the flowers.
    
    How? Who made this? Why is it here?
    
    The garden doesn't answer. It just... exists. Beautiful
    and inexplicable. A gift from whoever built this maze.

  ambience: |
    This place shouldn't exist. But it does.
    
    Maybe that's the real treasure of the maze — not gold or
    jewels, but this. A garden in the darkness. Life persisting.
    Beauty where beauty has no business being.
    
    You could stay here forever.
    
    (You shouldn't. There's still treasure to find. But you could.)
