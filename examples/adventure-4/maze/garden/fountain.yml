  description: |
    A small but elegant marble fountain, clearly ancient but
    perfectly maintained. Three tiers cascade water into a
    circular basin. The water is impossibly clear.
    
    No pipes visible. No obvious source. The water just...
    appears at the top and cycles endlessly. Magic, probably.
    
    Small coins glitter at the bottom of the basin.
