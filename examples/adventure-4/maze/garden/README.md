# 🌿 The Underground Garden

Life finds a way, even in the dark places.

## Description

An impossible garden in the depths of the maze. A shaft in the ceiling lets in genuine sunlight, nurturing real grass, flowers, and a magical fountain. Butterflies drift between the plants.

**Grue-safe** — sunlight keeps the darkness at bay.

## Biscuit's Assessment

- **Marked:** EVERY. CORNER. (6 locations documented)
- **Activities:** Zoomies achieved, grass roll completed, face submerged in fountain
- **Verdict:** "FAVORITE MAZE ROOM — OFFICIAL"

## The Zoomies Incident

> "OUTSIDE! INSIDE-OUTSIDE! PLANTS! GRASS-THAT-IS-NOT-GRASS! SUN-THAT-IS-NOT-SUN! EVERYTHING IS WONDERFUL!"

Don sat on the bench and smiled while Biscuit circled the entire garden in pure joy.
