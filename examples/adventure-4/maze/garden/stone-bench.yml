      effect: |
        You examine the carved messages:
        
        "REST HERE" — good advice
        "TRUST THE GARDEN" — cryptic but comforting
        "BUMBLEWICK WAS HERE" — previous adventurer
        "HELP I'M LOST" — concerning
        "NVM FOUND EXIT" — less concerning
        "THE GARDEN REMEMBERS" — what does that mean?
        
  biscuit_note: |
    Biscuit did not sit on the bench.
    Biscuit sat NEXT to the bench. On the grass.
    Then rolled in the grass. Then did zoomies.
    Then came back and lay near the bench while
    Don sat on it and smiled.
    
    Good bench. Good garden. Good day.
