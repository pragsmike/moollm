  description: |
    A FACE carved into the wall. Ancient, weathered, inscrutable.
    
    It might once have been a king, or a god, or possibly just
    someone's uncle who was really good at posing. Its empty
    eyes seem to follow you as you move.
    
    The face does not respond when you speak to it. Obviously.
    It's a face carved in rock.
    
    ...Probably.
  
  # What is it?
  mystery: |
    No one knows who carved it, or why, or when.
    
    It predates the maze. It predates the dungeon.
    Some say it predates the mountain itself.
    
    The face watches. The face judges. The face remembers.
  
  # It reacts to exits
  reactions:
    to_north: "frowns"     # Toward the skeleton
    to_south: "neutral"    # Toward the golden glow
    to_east: "approves"    # Toward the vendor
    to_west: "neutral"     # Toward the cobwebs
    
  reaction_interpretation: |
    The face seems to guide adventurers toward the vendor (east)
    and away from the skeleton (north). Make of that what you will.

        The face is carved from the living rock of the wall.
        The craftsmanship is remarkable — each wrinkle, each pore,
        rendered in perfect detail despite centuries of age.
        
        The eyes are empty sockets, yet you cannot shake the
        feeling that they see you. That they have ALWAYS seen you.

        "Hello?" you venture.
        
        The face does not respond. It's a face carved in rock.
        
        But was that a slight shift in the shadows around its mouth?
        A trick of the lamplight? Surely. Surely a trick of the light.

        "Which way should I go?"
        
        The face remains still. But you notice its expression
        seems slightly more approving when you face east.
        
        The vendor is east. Coincidence? Guidance? Pareidolia?

        You reach out and touch the carved stone.
        
        It's cold. Colder than it should be. Colder than the air.
        
        For a moment, you think you feel a pulse. But stone
        doesn't have a pulse. Stone doesn't breathe.
        
        ...Does it?

        You place [item] at the base of the carved face.
        
        The shadows in the eye sockets seem to deepen.
        Approval? Disdain? Hunger?

        Somewhere, you think you hear stone grinding against stone.
        
        The face's expression hasn't changed. Of course it hasn't.
        It's carved in rock.
        
        But you feel watched. More watched than before.

        You arrange your face to match the carved one.
        Stern. Impassive. Ancient.
        
        You hold the expression for a long moment.
        
        When you relax, you could swear the face looks...
        amused? No. That's impossible. Stone doesn't get amused.

  # Atmosphere
  ambience: |
    The carved face judges you silently. You adjust your waistcoat
    self-consciously. 
    
    Somewhere, you think you hear stone grinding against stone. 
    But that's impossible. Probably.
