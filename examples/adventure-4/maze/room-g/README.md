# 🗿 Room G — The Carved Face

> *"You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike."*

This one has a **FACE** carved into the wall. An ancient, weathered face that might once have been a king, or a god, or possibly just someone's uncle who was really good at posing.

Its empty eyes seem to follow you as you move.

*"Don't mind me," you say to it. "Just passing through."*

The face does not respond. Obviously. It's a face carved in rock.

## 🎭 Feature: The Carved Face

See [carved-face.yml](./carved-face.yml) for full details.

The face judges you silently. You adjust your waistcoat self-consciously. Somewhere, you think you hear stone grinding against stone. But that's impossible. Probably.

**The face reacts to exits:**
- Frowns at north (toward skeleton)
- Approves of east (toward vendor)

---

## 👃 Smell Notes

The face seems to sniff. Which is impossible. Probably.
