# 💀 The Skeleton
# A cautionary tale slumped against the wall

object:
  name: The Skeleton
  type: remains
  portable: false  # Too macabre to carry around
  
  description: |
    A skeleton slumped against the wall. An adventurer who didn't make it.
    
    Their bony fingers still clutch a note. Their empty eye sockets stare
    toward the west exit — toward the lamp vendor they never reached.
    
    The skeleton grins at you. Skeletons always grin. It's the lack of lips.
    Still, this one seems particularly smug about something.

  # The tragic backstory
  backstory: |
    This adventurer had over 100 gold! They were using coins as maze
    markers (terrible strategy — they all look alike). 
    
    When their lamp died in the cold room (room-f), they dropped 
    everything and ran. They almost made it to the vendor in room-j.
    
    Almost.
    
    Now they point west forever, a silent guide to those who come after.
  
  # The skeleton points west — toward salvation
  pointing: west
  pointing_toward: "../room-j/"
  pointing_meaning: "The lamp vendor. So close. So very close."

      result: |
        The skeleton slumps against the wall, one bony arm extended
        toward the west passage. Their empty lamp lies beside them.
        A partially-eaten note is clutched in their other hand.
        
    - action: READ-NOTE
      score: 75
      result: |
        You gently pry the note from skeletal fingers:
        
        "I should have brought more food to mark the rooms. 
        I dropped the cheese in room B and the bread in room D 
        but then I got confused and—"
        
        The writing ends mid-sentence. You can imagine the rest.
        
    - action: TAKE-LAMP
      score: 60
      result: |
        You pick up the empty lamp. It's identical to yours, just... empty.
        A sobering reminder of what happens when the light goes out.
        
        (You could refill it at the vendor in room-j, if you wanted
        a backup lamp. Redundancy is underrated in grue territory.)
        
    - action: TAKE-GOLD
      score: 50
      result: |
        You take the 3 gold pieces. The skeleton doesn't seem to mind.
        They won't be needing them where they're going.
        
        player.gold += 3
        
    - action: PAY-RESPECTS
      score: 70
      result: |
        You stand in respectful silence for a moment.
        
        "Rest well, fellow adventurer. Your sacrifice teaches us:
        bring food, not coins. And check your lamp oil. Often."
        
        The skeleton grins. Was that a nod? Probably just your imagination.
        
    - action: GIVE
      score: 40
      description: "Leave something for the skeleton"
      result: |
        You place [item] beside the skeleton as a memorial.
        The gesture feels right. Someone should remember them.
        
    - action: PROMISE
      score: 65
      description: "Make a promise to avenge them"
      result: |
        "I will avenge you," you say solemnly to the skeleton.
        "The grue that did this will pay."
        
        The skeleton seems to approve. Or maybe that's just the grin.

        "Your death is avenged, friend."
        The skeleton's grin seems... satisfied? Peaceful?
