# 💀 Room I — The Skeleton

> *"You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike."*

This one has a **SKELETON** slumped against the wall. An adventurer who didn't make it. Their bony fingers still clutch a note that reads:

> *"I should have brought more food to mark the rooms. I dropped the cheese in room B and the bread in room D but then I got confused and—"*

The note ends there. A cautionary tale.

## ⚠️ DANGER: DARK

This room has **no lighting**. Enter without a lit lamp and you will be eaten by a grue.

## 💀 The Skeleton's Story

See [skeleton.yml](./skeleton.yml) for full details.

This adventurer had over **100 gold!** They were using coins as maze markers (terrible strategy — they all look alike).

When their lamp died in the cold room ([room-f/](../room-f/)), they dropped everything and ran. They almost made it to the vendor in [room-j/](../room-j/). Almost.

**Skeleton's inventory:**
- Empty lamp (out of oil — they were SO CLOSE!)
- Note (partially eaten)
- 3 gold pieces (pocket change — the rest is in [room-f/](../room-f/)!)

## 🎭 Feature: The Skeleton

The skeleton grins at you. Skeletons always grin. It's the lack of lips. Still, this one seems particularly smug about something.

Maybe about knowing the way out. The jerk.

## 📜 Notes

- The skeleton **points west** toward the lamp vendor — so close to salvation!
