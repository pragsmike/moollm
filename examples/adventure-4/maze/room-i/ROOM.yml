    It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
    
    As the grue approaches, you think you hear the skeleton
    rattling. Is it laughing? Can skeletons laugh? You won't
    live long enough to find out.

    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    
    This one has a SKELETON slumped against the wall. An
    adventurer who didn't make it. Their bony fingers still
    clutch a note that reads: "I should have brought more food
    to mark the rooms. I dropped the cheese in room B and the
    bread in room D but then I got confused and—"
    
    The note ends there. A cautionary tale.

    south:
      destination: ../room-g/
      description: "A carved face watches from that direction."
    east:
      destination: ../room-f/
      description: "A cold breeze blows from there."
    west:
      destination: ../room-j/
      description: "The skeleton seems to be pointing this way."
  
  ambience: |
    The skeleton grins at you. Skeletons always grin. It's the
    lack of lips. Still, this one seems particularly smug about
    something. Maybe about knowing the way out. The jerk.

      This room contains the bones of one who came before.
      The note tells their story. They got confused.
