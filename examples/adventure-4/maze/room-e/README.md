# 🕸️ Room E — The Cobwebs

> *"You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike."*

This one is FULL of cobwebs. Ancient, dusty cobwebs that suggest the spiders who made them have long since moved on to more profitable real estate.

The webs catch your lamp light and sparkle like... well, like dusty spider webs.

You resist the urge to scream. Barely.

## 🎭 Feature: The Cobwebs

The cobwebs drift gently in unfelt breezes. Nothing moves. But you can't shake the feeling of being watched by eight eyes. Or possibly eighty. Or eight hundred.

## 👃 Smell Notes

Cobwebs trap smells. This room holds the ghosts of previous markers longer than most.
