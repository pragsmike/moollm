    It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
    
    You walk face-first into a cobweb. While you're distracted
    wiping spider silk off your face, the grue strikes.

    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    
    This one is FULL of cobwebs. Ancient, dusty cobwebs that
    suggest the spiders who made them have long since moved on
    to more profitable real estate. The webs catch your lamp
    light and sparkle like... well, like dusty spider webs.
    
    You resist the urge to scream. Barely.

  ambience: |
    The cobwebs drift gently in unfelt breezes. Nothing moves.
    But you can't shake the feeling of being watched by eight
    eyes. Or possibly eighty. Or eight hundred.
