    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    
    Well, not ENTIRELY alike. This one is slightly damp. Water seeps
    through a crack in the ceiling, forming a small puddle that reflects
    your bewildered face back at you. The puddle seems judgmental.
    
    Passages lead in all directions. They all look the same.
    This is MOST irregular.

  # Distinguishing feature (for the observant)
  feature: puddle
  ambience: |
    Drip. Drip. Drip. The puddle grows imperceptibly larger.
    Or does it? Hard to tell. Everything is hard to tell in here.

    assessment: |
      SO MANY SMELLS. This is the best place.
      Every direction is a new smell.
      I need to investigate ALL of them.

      The maze begins here. I have claimed the entrance.
      Future dogs will know: Biscuit explored this way.
