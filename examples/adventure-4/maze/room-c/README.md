# ✍️ Room C — The Scratch Marks

> *"You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike."*

The walls are covered with desperate scribblings of previous adventurers trying to map their way out. Most are just tally marks. One reads "HELP". Another reads "DROPPED MY SANDWICH HERE".

Someone has helpfully written "THIS WAY OUT →" with an arrow pointing at a solid wall.

| **South** | [room-d/](../room-d/) | Smiley face drawn here. Unsettling. |

| **West** | [room-a/](../room-a/) | Arrow pointing this way. Trust it? |

## 🎭 Feature: The Scratch Marks

A cautionary archive of failure. Previous adventurers left their marks — literally. Some helpful. Most not.

**Notable scratches:**
- "BEWARE THE GRU—" (unfinished)
- "BUMBLEWICK WAS HERE (RELUCTANTLY)"
- "IF FOUND, RETURN TO MOTHER"

## 👃 Smell Notes

Old smells linger here. Markers from long ago still faintly detectable. Ancient cheese, ancient failure.
