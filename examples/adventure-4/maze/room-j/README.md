# 🏪 Room J — The Crossroads

> *"You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike."*

This one feels... different. A **CROSSROADS** of sorts. The passages here seem more deliberate, as if someone planned this junction.

Against one wall stands a battered **VENDING MACHINE**, humming softly. Its display reads "ACME LAMP REFUELING CO." The glow from its buttons provides just enough light to read by, but not enough to keep grues at bay.

Someone has scratched "LIFESAVER" into the casing.

## ⚠️ DANGER: DARK

This room has **no lighting** (the vending machine's glow doesn't count). Enter without a lit lamp and you will be eaten by a grue.

|-----------|-------------|-------------|

## 🎭 Feature: The Crossroads

This is the kind of place where destinies are decided. Or at least where you decide which direction to go next.

The skeleton in [room-i/](../room-i/) was pointing this way — so close to salvation!

---

## 🔮 Expansion Point

Room J is the **northern frontier** of the known maze. The vendor's display occasionally flickers with hints of passages to the north... but they haven't been mapped yet.
