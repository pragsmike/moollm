room:

    It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
    
    Four passages, four directions, four chances to escape.
    None of them matter when you can't see the grue coming
    from the fifth direction. (There is no fifth direction.
    That's what makes grues so terrifying.)

    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    
    This one feels... different. A CROSSROADS of sorts. The
    passages here seem more deliberate, as if someone planned
    this junction. Four exits lead in four directions, each
    equally promising, equally threatening.
    
    Against one wall stands a battered VENDING MACHINE, humming
    softly. Its display reads "ACME LAMP REFUELING CO." The glow
    from its buttons provides just enough light to read by, but
    not enough to keep grues at bay.
    
    Someone has scratched "LIFESAVER" into the casing.

  # This is a central hub in the expanded maze
  note: "The crossroads connects to many other maze rooms. The skeleton in room-i was pointing this way — so close to salvation!"

      description: "A faint green glow — mushrooms?"
    east:
      destination: ../room-i/
      description: "You hear bones rattling. Probably the wind."
    west:
      destination: ../room-g/

    This is the kind of place where destinies are decided.
    Or at least where you decide which direction to go next.
    Choose wisely. Or don't. You'll reincarnate either way.
