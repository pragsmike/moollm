# ✨ Room D — The Golden Glow

> *"You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike."*

But wait — this one has a **faint golden glow** coming from one of the passages! Could it be? After all this wandering, could you finally be near the TREASURE?

Your heart leaps! Your waistcoat rustles with anticipation!

## ⚠️ DANGER: DARK

This room has **no lighting** (the glow comes from the NEXT room). Enter without a lit lamp and you will be eaten by a grue.

*"So close. So very, very close."*
