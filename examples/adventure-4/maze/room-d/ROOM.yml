# Maze Room D
# A twisty little passage

room:
  name: Twisty Passage (Golden Glow)
  type: maze_room
  
  # DANGER! This room is dark!
  # (The golden glow is from the NEXT room, not THIS room)
  lighting: none
  grue_safe: false
  requires_light: true
  
  # What happens if you enter without light
  grue_event: |
    It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
    
    You can ALMOST see a golden glow from somewhere nearby...
    but not quite. The grue, however, can see you perfectly well.
    
    🎵 "Twenty-two years later, head's infested: got the grue in.
        PLUGHing, XYZZYfying, trying to escape,
        but I can't 'cause I'm up and around and awake." 🎵

    You have been eaten by a grue.
    
    So close. So very, very close.

    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    
    But wait — this one has a faint golden glow coming from one of
    the passages! Could it be? After all this wandering, could you
    finally be near the TREASURE? Your heart leaps! Your waistcoat
    rustles with anticipation!
    
    Passages lead in all directions. One of them DEFINITELY glows.
  
  # This room connects FORWARD to end
  note: "The NORTH exit leads to the Treasury!"
  
  exits:
    north:
      destination: ../../end/
      description: "A passage suffused with warm golden light. THIS IS IT!"
    south:
      destination: ../room-a/
      description: "Back into the maze. Why would you go this way?"
    east:
      destination: ../room-b/
      description: "The glow fades this direction. Probably a bad choice."
    west:
      destination: ../room-c/
      description: "More scratchy walls. More existential dread."
  
  # Distinguishing feature
  feature: glow
  ambience: |
    The golden light beckons from the north. It whispers of treasure,
    of triumph, of finally having something to tell Mother about.
    Also possibly of being late for dinner, but that ship has sailed.
