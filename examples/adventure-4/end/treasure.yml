object:
  name: Jeweled Chalice
  type: treasure
  
  description: |
    A chalice of surpassing loveliness, crusted with gems that sparkle
    even in dim light. It's the sort of thing that belongs in a museum,
    or possibly a well-lit display case in your living room. The gems
    appear to spell out "THIS IS A TREASURE" in very small letters,
    presumably to help appraisers.

    The chalice is gold — real gold, not that "gold-tone" nonsense.
    Rubies and emeralds alternate around the rim in a pattern that
    probably means something to somebody. On the base, an inscription
    reads: "Congratulations! You have found a treasure worth 10 points.
    Please deposit in well house for credit."
    
    Wait, that can't be right. But there it is.

        You lift the Jeweled Chalice from its pedestal. It's surprisingly
        heavy — real gold does that. The gems sparkle triumphantly.

  # Tribute
  lineage: |
    Treasures have been the goal of adventures since Crowther hid them
    in Colossal Cave. Scott Adams scattered them across his many worlds.
    The Implementors at Infocom elevated treasure-hunting to an art form.
    This chalice honors them all.
