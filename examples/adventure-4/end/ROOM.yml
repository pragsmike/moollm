    You emerge into a small but decidedly impressive chamber. The walls
    are lined with empty pedestals — this place was clearly cleaned out
    by previous adventurers, those inconsiderate loot-hoggers.
    
    But wait! One pedestal remains occupied. Upon it sits a JEWELED CHALICE
    of the sort that belongs in a museum, or possibly your inventory.
    A shaft of golden light from an implausible source illuminates it
    dramatically. Someone really thought this through.
    
    The exit SOUTH leads back into the maze — that twisty, grue-infested
    nightmare you just escaped. You'd have to navigate it again to return
    to the start. Worth considering. (Or just stay here with your chalice.)
    
    (Your score is still 0 until you actually GET the treasure. We're
    not just giving points away here.)

        The archway back into the maze. The twisty passages await, ready
        to confuse you all over again. Going this way would mean braving
        the maze BACKWARDS. Are you sure? You have the treasure now.
        You could just... stay here. Forever. With your chalice.
        
        No? Back into the maze it is. Mother would be proud. Insufferably so.
