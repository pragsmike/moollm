  description: |
    A well-worn kitchen table, scarred by decades of Fantastipants
    family meals. You can see the mark where young Bumblewick once
    carved his initials (and was grounded for a week). You can see
    the burn mark from the Great Porridge Incident of '03.

    On the table sits a NOTE, written in familiar handwriting:
    
    "Dearest Bumblewick,
    
    If you're reading this, you've been transported to another
    mysterious underground adventure. AGAIN. I've stocked the
    refrigerator with provisions. The food is for DROPPING IN
    THE MAZE to mark your path, not for EATING.
    
    Don't forget your lamp. Don't get eaten by grues. Don't
    embarrass the family name.
    
    Your loving Mother,
    Petunia Fantastipants
    
    P.S. - When you get home, we need to talk about those dishes."
