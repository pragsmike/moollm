    You stand in a cozy kitchen that feels oddly familiar — perhaps because
    it's an EXACT replica of the Fantastipants family kitchen from 
    Wobblebrook-upon-Squiggle. Someone has gone to considerable trouble
    to recreate it underground, right down to the motivational embroidery
    that reads "BLESS THIS MESS (BUT ALSO CLEAN IT UP, BUMBLEWICK)".
    
    A REFRIGERATOR hums contentedly in the corner, stuffed with provisions.
    A STOVE sits cold and patient. A SINK contains the eternal mystery
    of dishes that weren't there a moment ago. A TABLE holds a note.
    
    Mother would be impressed. Actually, no, Mother would find something
    to criticize. She always does.
    
    The exit EAST leads back to the Chamber of Commencement, from which
    you can go NORTH to the maze, or EAST to the costume emporium.

        The archway back to the Chamber of Commencement. You can see
        the warm glow of the starting room from here.

  ambience: |
    The fridge hums. A clock ticks somewhere. The smell of home cooking
    lingers, though nothing is cooking. It's the MEMORY of cooking.
    
    This kitchen exists specifically so you have food to drop in the maze.
    We're not being subtle about it.
