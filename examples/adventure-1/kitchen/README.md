# The Kitchen

> *"The food is for DROPPING IN THE MAZE, not for EATING."*
> — Petunia Fantastipants

An exact replica of the Fantastipants family kitchen from Wobblebrook-upon-Squiggle, mysteriously recreated underground. How thoughtful! And slightly creepy!

## Why a Kitchen?

**The classic maze-mapping technique:**

1. Take food from the fridge
2. Enter the maze
3. DROP a unique item in each room
4. When you return to a room: "I see a Wheel of Cheese here!"
5. You know you've been here before!

**20 foods ÷ 10 maze rooms = 2 markers per room (if needed)**
