# The Refrigerator
# A cornucopia of maze-mapping provisions

object:
  name: Fantastipants Family Refrigerator
  type: container
  
  description: |
    A magnificent refrigerator of the old-fashioned sort, with rounded
    corners and a satisfying CHUNK when you open the door. A magnet
    on the front reads "WORLD'S OKAYEST ADVENTURER".
    
    It is STUFFED with food. An improbable amount of food. The kind of
    food supply that suggests someone knows you're about to enter a maze
    and need things to drop.
  
  examine: |
    You open the refrigerator. A gentle light illuminates a treasure
    trove of edibles, each one distinct enough to mark a different
    room in a maze. How convenient!

  # Helpful hint
  hint: |
    PRO TIP: Take all this food and DROP items in maze rooms to mark
    where you've been. This is the classic adventure game technique
    for mapping "twisty little passages, all alike."
    
    20 items = 20 rooms you can uniquely mark. You have 10 maze rooms.
    Math is on your side!
