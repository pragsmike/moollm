    A magnificent cast iron stove, cold and dormant. A kettle sits on
    top, waiting patiently for someone to make tea. The stove has seen
    better days, and also worse days, and also days where Bumblewick
    tried to make toast and somehow set water on fire.
  
  examine: |
    The stove is OFF. This is probably for the best. Adventures and
    cooking rarely mix well, and you have a maze to navigate.
    
    The kettle looks hopeful. You feel guilty.
