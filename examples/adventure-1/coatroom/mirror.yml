# The Mirror
# Shows your current transformation

object:
  name: Full-Length Mirror of Truth (and Fashion)
  type: fixture
  
  description: |
    An ornate full-length mirror in a gilded frame carved with masks
    of comedy and tragedy. The glass seems impossibly clear, showing
    not just your reflection but somehow your ESSENCE.
    
    A small plaque reads: "Mirror, mirror, on the stand / show the
    hero, costume planned."
  
  examine: |
    You peer into the mirror...
    
    [The mirror shows your current character description, updated
    to reflect whatever costume you're wearing. If you're still
    in your default waistcoat, it shows Bumblewick in all his
    reluctant-hero glory.]

      response: |
        You pose heroically. The mirror captures it perfectly.
        Somewhere, a camera flash goes off. There is no camera.

      response: |
        You make a face. Your reflection makes the same face.
        For a moment, you're not sure who started it.
