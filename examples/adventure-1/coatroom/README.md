# The Coat Room

> *"Be anyone you want!"*
> — The Fantastipants Costume Emporium

A vast circular chamber of infinite costume possibilities. Transform yourself completely!

---

## How It Works

The coat room rewrites your **character description** based on what you wear. Your costume persists throughout the adventure!

### Commands

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `WEAR [description]` | Become that costume! |
| `WEAR RANDOM` | Surprise costume! |
| `COMBINE [a] WITH [b]` | Mash-up two costumes! |
| `ADD [accessory]` | Add to current costume |
| `ADD TO INVENTORY [item]` | Get a costume-appropriate item |
| `REMOVE COSTUME` | Back to default Bumblewick |
| `LOOK IN MIRROR` | See your current appearance |

## Examples

**Simple:**
```
> WEAR pirate captain

You are now Captain Bumblewick "Blackwaistcoat" Fantastipants!
Tricorn hat, brass buttons, foam cutlass, and a parrot puppet
that squawks unconvincingly.
```

**Combination:**
```
> COMBINE astronaut WITH Victorian gentleman

You emerge as Space Explorer Sir Bumblewick Fantastipants III,
in a silver spacesuit with a top hat sealed to the helmet and
a monocle painted on the visor.
```

**Custom:**
```
> WEAR a sentient cloud of bees wearing a tiny crown

The mannequin nods approvingly. Somehow, this exists.
You are now... The Bee Emperor. Buzz buzz.
```

**Add accessories:**
```
> ADD a jetpack

Your costume now includes a jetpack! (Decorative only. 
Or is it? Try pressing the button in the maze...)

> ADD TO INVENTORY rubber chicken

You now have: Rubber Chicken (squeaks when squeezed)
```
