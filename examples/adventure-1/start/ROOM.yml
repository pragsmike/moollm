    The darkness swallows you whole. But wait—
    
    A warm light. A sense of beginnings. The smell of slightly
    damp stone and narrative convenience.
    
    You awaken in the Chamber of Commencement. Your score has
    been reset to 0, but your inventory remains intact. The 
    universe is merciful, if slightly disappointed in you.
    
    "Well," mutters Bumblewick, checking his waistcoat for grue
    damage, "THAT was unpleasant. Mother will never hear of this."

    You are standing in a small chamber carved from living rock. The walls
    bear the scratched initials of adventurers past: "WC+DW '76", "SA '78",
    and mysteriously, "XYZZY WAS HERE".
    
    The chamber is suffused with a soft, sourceless glow — the kind of
    magical light that adventure games provide to starting areas so that
    heroes don't immediately die in the dark. How thoughtful.
    
    A brass lamp sits on a natural stone shelf. You should probably TAKE
    that before going anywhere. Just a friendly suggestion. No reason.
    
    Three exits beckon:
    
    NORTH: A rough archway leading into ABSOLUTE darkness. The kind where
    you are likely to be eaten by a grue.
    
    WEST: A cheerful doorway smelling of home cooking. The Fantastipants
    Family Kitchen, somehow recreated underground.
    
    EAST: An ornate doorway draped in velvet. Costumes glitter beyond.
    The Fantastipants Costume Emporium awaits.
    
    (Your score is 0 of a possible 10 points, in 0 moves.)

        A rough archway carved through the rock. Beyond it, shadows pool
        like spilled ink. Your lamp's light doesn't quite reach whatever
        lies ahead. You have a bad feeling about this. The kind of feeling
        one gets before entering a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
        
        Someone has scratched "ABANDON HOPE" on the archway, then crossed
        it out and written "ACTUALLY IT'S NOT THAT BAD" underneath.
        
    west:
      destination: ../kitchen/
      description: |
        A cheerful doorway leads to what smells like... home? The unmistakable
        aroma of the Fantastipants family kitchen wafts through. Someone has
        recreated it down here. How thoughtful! And slightly creepy!
        
    east:
      destination: ../coatroom/
      description: |
        An ornate doorway draped with velvet curtains in a dozen clashing colors.
        Beyond, you glimpse racks upon racks of costumes — feathers, sequins, 
        armor, ball gowns, spacesuits, and things that defy description.
        
        A sign reads: "THE FANTASTIPANTS COSTUME EMPORIUM — BE ANYONE YOU WANT!"

  ambience: |
    Water drips somewhere in the darkness — the universal soundtrack
    of underground adventure. The air is cool and smells of earth,
    mystery, and faintly of ancient riddles.
