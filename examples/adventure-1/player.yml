  # The backstory
  backstory: |
    In a hole in the ground there lived a Fantastipants. Not a nasty, 
    dirty, wet hole filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, 
    nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on 
    or to eat: it was a Fantastipants-hole, and that means COMFORT.
    
    (The secret word is "COMFORT!" When you hear it, SCREAM REAL LOUD!)
    
    Bumblewick Fantastipants had lived in the pleasant village of 
    Wobblebrook-upon-Squiggle for all of his forty-seven years, 
    tending his magnificent collection of decorative spoons and 
    speaking exclusively in rhyming couplets on Tuesdays. His mother,
    the legendary Petunia Fantastipants, had been a great adventurer
    in her youth — she once retrieved a slightly magic napkin from
    the Cave of Moderate Danger and was celebrated throughout the land
    for approximately one afternoon.
    
    "Adventures," Bumblewick was fond of saying, "make one late for dinner."
    
    But fate, that mischievous playwright, had other plans! One morning,
    Bumblewick awoke not in his comfortable Fantastipants-hole but in
    a MYSTERIOUS STONE CHAMBER, with no memory of how he got there and
    a strong suspicion that someone had been messing about with the
    narrative fabric of reality again.
    
    "Well," said Bumblewick, straightening his waistcoat (he always wore
    a waistcoat, even to bed, even in mysterious stone chambers), "I 
    suppose I shall have to become a hero. Mother will be ABSOLUTELY
    INSUFFERABLE about this at dinner. If I ever get to dinner."
    
    And so begins the tale of Bumblewick Fantastipants, reluctant 
    adventurer, spoon enthusiast, and hero of this particular story
    whether he likes it or not (he does not, but he's being very
    polite about it).
    
    MEKKA-LEKKA-HI, MEKKA-HINEY-HO!

  # Notes and memories
  notes: |
    I awaken in the Chamber of Commencement. I do not recall arriving here.
    This is MOST irregular. My spoons must be terribly worried.
    
    Three exits present themselves:
    - NORTH: A dark archway leading to... a maze? Grues? Both?
    - WEST: A kitchen! It smells like home! (Suspiciously convenient.)
    - EAST: A costume emporium! (WHO BUILT THIS PLACE?!)
    
    A brass lamp offers companionship in this trying time. I should
    probably TAKE it before venturing north. Just a feeling.
    
    I must be brave. I must be bold. I must remember to moisturize
    even in underground caverns. Mother always said: "Good skin
    opens doors, Bumblewick. Sometimes literally."
