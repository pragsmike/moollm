    It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
    
    You shiver. It's SO cold. The grue, being cold-blooded (probably),
    doesn't mind at all.

    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    
    This one is FREEZING. Your breath fogs in the lamp light.
    Your waistcoat provides little comfort. This is the kind
    of cold that has nothing to do with temperature and
    everything to do with something deeply wrong with reality.
    
    "MOST irregular," you mutter through chattering teeth.

  ambience: |
    Your waistcoat's buttons are FREEZING against your chest.
    You pull it tighter anyway. It's the principle of the thing.
