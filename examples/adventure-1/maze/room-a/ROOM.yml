    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    
    Well, not ENTIRELY alike. This one is slightly damp. Water seeps
    through a crack in the ceiling, forming a small puddle that reflects
    your bewildered face back at you. The puddle seems judgmental.
    
    Passages lead in all directions. They all look the same.
    This is MOST irregular.

      description: "Wait... is that lamplight? Could this lead back?"
    east:
      destination: ../room-b/
      description: "A passage. Twisty. Little. You know the drill."

      destination: ../room-d/
      description: "Another passage, equally twisty, equally little"
  
  # Distinguishing feature (for the observant)
  feature: puddle
  ambience: |
    Drip. Drip. Drip. The puddle grows imperceptibly larger.
    Or does it? Hard to tell. Everything is hard to tell in here.
