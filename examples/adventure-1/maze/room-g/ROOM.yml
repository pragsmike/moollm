    It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
    
    The carved face watches impassively as the grue approaches.
    It's seen this before. It will see it again.

    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    
    This one has a FACE carved into the wall. An ancient, weathered
    face that might once have been a king, or a god, or possibly
    just someone's uncle who was really good at posing. Its empty
    eyes seem to follow you as you move.
    
    "Don't mind me," you say to it. "Just passing through."
    
    The face does not respond. Obviously. It's a face carved in rock.

  ambience: |
    The carved face judges you silently. You adjust your waistcoat
    self-consciously. Somewhere, you think you hear stone grinding
    against stone. But that's impossible. Probably.
