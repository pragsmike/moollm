  grue_event: |
    It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
    
    You trip on a mushroom. The grue does not trip. Grues are
    surprisingly sure-footed in the dark.

    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    
    This one has MUSHROOMS growing everywhere. Luminescent fungi
    that provide a faint, sickly green glow — not enough to
    prevent grue attacks, but enough to make everything look
    deeply unsettling. Some of them pulse gently.
    
    Mother would say not to touch them. Mother would be right.

  ambience: |
    The mushrooms pulse in a rhythm that almost sounds like breathing.
    You try not to think about what's breathing. You fail.
