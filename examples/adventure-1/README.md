# Adventure 1: The Minimal Quest

> *"Every journey begins with two rooms."*

The simplest possible adventure: one hero, two rooms, one door.

**...that grew into a 28-file grue-infested costume-wearing food-dropping masterpiece.**

---

## 🎬 How This World Was Bootstrapped

This adventure was built **entirely through conversation**. Starting from nothing, each chat message added a new feature. The README you're reading IS the chat log — a record of collaborative world-building between human and LLM.

### The Bootstrapping Philosophy

1. **Start minimal** — Two rooms, one hero, one door
2. **Add features incrementally** — Each request extends the world
3. **Document as you go** — The README grows with the world
4. **Coherence check** — Periodically verify everything links correctly
5. **The chat IS the tutorial** — Anyone can follow along

### What Makes This Special

- **No templates used** — Built from scratch through dialogue
- **Every file has a story** — We can trace why each thing exists
- **Iterative refinement** — Files were modified multiple times
- **Human + LLM collaboration** — Ideas flow both directions

## The Chat That Created This

**User:** Create a first "adventure-1" subdir. Instantiate a new adventure there with an initial player, with two rooms — south is "start" and north is "end" and they have links back and forth. The player starts in start. They are the generic hero protagonist.

**DM:** Creating the minimal adventure...

---

## Try It Yourself

```
> look
You are standing in a small chamber carved from living rock.
The walls bear scratched initials: "WC+DW '76", "SA '78", "XYZZY WAS HERE".
A brass lamp sits on a stone shelf. An archway leads NORTH.

> take lamp
Taken. The lamp feels reassuringly solid in your hand.

> go north
You step through the archway...

You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
This one is slightly damp. A puddle reflects your bewildered face.
Passages lead N, S, E, W.

> go west
You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
This one has a golden glow from the NORTH passage!

> go north
You emerge into the Treasury of Modest Proportions! 
A JEWELED CHALICE gleams on a pedestal!

> take chalice
Taken! Your score is now 10 of 10 points!

"Well," says Bumblewick, adjusting his waistcoat, "that wasn't 
so bad. Mother will be ABSOLUTELY INSUFFERABLE about this."

> inventory
You are carrying:
  - A brass lamp (lit)
  - A jeweled chalice (10 points)
  - Your dignity (barely)
```

**The solution:** START → N → MAZE-A → W → MAZE-D → N → END

---

## Chat Continues: Adding Objects

**User:** Let's create a lamp and put it in the start room, and create a treasure and put it in the end room. Give all rooms and objects imaginative creative witty descriptions in the tradition of Zork and Adventure and Scott Adams Adventure. Use cultural references and tributes.

**DM:** Ah, you want the REAL adventure experience! Let me channel Crowther, Woods, Adams, and the Implementors...

### Added: [start/lamp.yml](./start/lamp.yml) — The Brass Lamp

A classic! No adventure is complete without a light source of dubious reliability.

### Added: [end/treasure.yml](./end/treasure.yml) — The MacGuffin

The thing you came for. Worth approximately 10 points.

---

## Chat Continues: The Hero Awakes

**User:** The hero awakes! Write a flowery romantic backstory, in the style of The Hobbit, but with a good dose of Pee Wee's Playhouse. Choose a silly name for the hero.

**DM:** *Clears throat dramatically*

### Updated: [player.yml](./player.yml) — Bumblewick Fantastipants

*"In a hole in the ground there lived a Fantastipants..."*

Our hero is now **Bumblewick Fantastipants**, a reluctant adventurer from the pleasant village of Wobblebrook-upon-Squiggle. He is:

- A devoted spoon enthusiast (magnificent collection, now tragically far away)
- A Tuesday rhymer (speaks only in couplets on Tuesdays)
- A waistcoat devotee (wears one always, even to bed)
- The son of the legendary Petunia Fantastipants (who once retrieved a slightly magic napkin from the Cave of Moderate Danger)

He awoke in the Chamber of Commencement with no memory of how he arrived, suspecting someone has been "messing about with the narrative fabric of reality again."

**The secret word is "COMFORT!" When you hear it, SCREAM REAL LOUD!**

MEKKA-LEKKA-HI, MEKKA-HINEY-HO!

---

## Chat Continues: The Maze

**User:** Add a twisty maze between start and end, of four rooms. One room's exit should go to start and another room's exit should go to end, but the other four compass directions of each room are tangled!

**DM:** Ah, the classic! "You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike." Let me tangle those passages...

### Added: [maze/](./maze/) — A Maze of Twisty Little Passages

Four rooms, each with a distinguishing feature (for the observant):

| Room | Feature | What Makes It Special |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| [room-a/](./maze/room-a/) | Puddle | Slightly damp, judgmental water |
| [room-b/](./maze/room-b/) | Echo | Your mockery returns to you |
| [room-c/](./maze/room-c/) | Scratches | "THIS WAY OUT →" points at wall |
| [room-d/](./maze/room-d/) | Golden glow | The way forward! |

**The tangled connections:**

```
room-a: N→C  S→start  E→B  W→D
room-b: N→D  S→C      E→A  W→C
room-c: N→B  S→D      E→D  W→A
room-d: N→end S→A     E→B  W→C
```

**The solution:** Start → N → room-a → W → room-d → N → Treasury!

Or wander. Wandering builds character.

---

## Chat Continues: Grues!

**User:** If I enter the maze without the lamp in my inventory and lit, then I get eaten by a grue. But the start and end rooms are magically lit. The maze rooms are dark and dangerous without a source of light!

**DM:** Ah yes, the GRUE. The original survival horror monster. Let me add the appropriate dread...

### The Lighting Rules

| Room | Lighting | Grue Safe? |
|------|----------|------------|
| start/ | Magical | ✅ Yes |
| maze/* | **NONE** | ❌ NO |
| end/ | Magical | ✅ Yes |

### What Happens Without a Lamp

```
> go north
It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

...

You have been eaten by a grue.

> RESTART, RESTORE, or QUIT?
```

Each maze room has a unique grue death message with lyrics from **[MC Frontalot's "It Is Pitch Dark"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nigRT2KmCE)**:

- **room-a**: *"If this predicament seems particularly cruel..."*
- **room-b**: *"It got narrated at you in the second person..."*
- **room-c**: *"Could be the spray for the grue; you're gonna need it..."*
- **room-d**: *"Twenty-two years later, head's infested: got the grue in..."*

> 🎵 *"Thanks, Grampa, for buying it. Now my life's ruined."* 🎵
>
> Nerdcore is the future. Front is a lyricist without equal.

### The Lamp Saves You

```yaml
# The lamp must be:
lamp:
  lit: true           # ON, not off
  in_inventory: true  # Not left behind in start!
  fuel: > 0           # Still has fuel
```

**GET LAMP. This is not a suggestion.**

*([Get Lamp](http://www.getlamp.com/) — the documentary)*

---

## Chat Continues: Reincarnation

**User:** When you're eaten by a grue, or killed in any way, you get reincarnated in the start room, with your score zeroed out, but you keep your inventory.

**DM:** A merciful cosmos! Death is but a temporary setback...

### The Death & Rebirth Cycle

```yaml
# On any death (grue, trap, existential despair):
death_event:
  action: reincarnate
  location: start           # Back to the beginning
  score: 0                  # Points reset to zero
  inventory: preserved      # You keep your stuff!
  moves: preserved          # Move count continues
```

### What Happens

```
You have been eaten by a grue.

...

The darkness swallows you whole. But wait—

A warm light. A sense of beginnings. The smell of slightly
damp stone and narrative convenience.

You awaken in the Chamber of Commencement. Your score has
been reset to 0, but your inventory remains intact. The 
universe is merciful, if slightly disappointed in you.

"Well," says Bumblewick, checking his waistcoat, "THAT was
unpleasant. At least I still have my lamp."
```

### Why Keep Inventory?

- **Prevents softlocks** — Can't lose the lamp forever
- **Rewards exploration** — Found items stay found
- **Reduces frustration** — Death is a setback, not a restart
- **Classic roguelike mercy** — Some games call this "soul recovery"

The treasure's points don't count until you survive to the end!

---

## Chat Continues: Kitchen & Expanded Maze

**User:** Make a Kitchen to the west from start, with a fridge and other objects. Put a bunch of delicious foods in the fridge, that the player can drop to map the maze. Add 20 interesting diverse food items to the fridge, then make six more maze rooms (for a total of 10).

**DM:** Ah, the CLASSIC maze-mapping technique! Let me stock that kitchen...

### Added: [kitchen/](./kitchen/) — The Fantastipants Family Kitchen

An exact replica of home, complete with:
- **[fridge.yml](./kitchen/fridge.yml)** — 20 unique food items for maze mapping!
- **[stove.yml](./kitchen/stove.yml)** — Not currently in use (adventures first)
- **[sink.yml](./kitchen/sink.yml)** — Perpetually containing dishes
- **[table.yml](./kitchen/table.yml)** — With a note from Mother

### The 20 Foods (for Maze Mapping!)

| # | Food | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | Suspiciously Perfect Apple | Snow White would be suspicious |
| 2 | Wheel of Aged Cheese | Sharp cheddar, aged 47 years |
| 3 | Loaf of Crusty Bread | Still warm. Defies thermodynamics. |
| 4 | Jar of Pickled Herring | A family delicacy. Distinctive smell. |
| 5 | Leftover Shepherd's Pie | Tuesday's dinner |
| 6 | Bunch of Purple Grapes | Mother's favorite |
| 7 | Pot of Mysterious Stew | "DO NOT EAT - EXPERIMENT" |
| 8 | Wedge of Blue Cheese | The mold is supposed to be there |
| 9 | Cold Roast Chicken | Missing one leg |
| 10 | Jar of Strawberry Jam | Grandmother's recipe |
| 11 | Half-Empty Bottle of Milk | Or half-full |
| 12 | Suspicious Casserole | Aunt Petunia's "special recipe" |
| 13 | Lemon (Judgmental) | It seems to be frowning |
| 14 | Slice of Birthday Cake | Three months old. Sentient frosting. |
| 15 | Carrot (Heroically Orange) | Good for your eyes |
| 16 | Tin of Sardines | Emergency rations |
| 17 | Bowl of Cold Porridge | Goldilocks rejected this one |
| 18 | Fancy Imported Salami | From THE Old Country |
| 19 | Single Hard-Boiled Egg | Looking existential |
| 20 | Jar of Olives (Green) | Stuffed with pimentos. Tradition. |

### Added: 6 More Maze Rooms (10 total!)

| Room | Feature | What You'll Find |
|------|---------|------------------|
| room-e | Cobwebs | Ancient dusty webs, feeling of being watched |
| room-f | Cold Spot | Freezing! Something wrong with reality |
| room-g | Carved Face | Judging you silently |
| room-h | Mushrooms | Faint green glow (insufficient for safety!) |
| room-i | Skeleton | Previous adventurer. Cautionary tale. |
| room-j | Crossroads | Central hub. Metaphorical significance. |

**20 foods ÷ 10 rooms = 2 markers per room if you're REALLY careful!**

---

## Chat Continues: The Coat Room

**User:** Make two-way east/west links so the kitchen is to the west of the start, and make a new room to the east of the start, the coat room, which has a spectacular collection of formal and wild costumes. It mentions many interesting ones but you can request any costume you can describe, or a random one. It rewrites your character description for the costume! You can also combine costumes or customize them in any way. You can even add inventory items and accessories!

**DM:** A costume emporium! Now Bumblewick can be ANYONE while navigating the grue-infested maze!

### Added: [coatroom/](./coatroom/) — The Fantastipants Costume Emporium

A vast circular chamber where you can completely transform your character!

**Commands:**

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `WEAR pirate captain` | Become a pirate! |
| `WEAR RANDOM` | Surprise costume |
| `COMBINE wizard WITH detective` | Mash-up! |
| `ADD a monocle` | Accessorize |
| `ADD TO INVENTORY rubber chicken` | Get items! |
| `LOOK IN MIRROR` | See yourself |

**Objects:**
- **Mirror** — Shows your transformation
- **Mannequin** — Helpful costume consultant (faceless but enthusiastic)
- **Costume Racks** — Infinite possibilities

**Featured Costumes:**
- Dread Pirate Fantastipants (with parrot puppet)
- Space Explorer (ray gun goes "pew pew")
- Victorian Detective (Watson is a sock puppet)
- Actually Just Three Corgis (in a trenchcoat)

**The costume rewrites your character description!**

```
BEFORE: Bumblewick in his waistcoat, bewildered but optimistic
AFTER:  Captain Bumblewick "Blackwaistcoat" Fantastipants, dread pirate!
```

## Chat Continues: The Eating Mechanic

**User:** Your mother warned you not to eat the food. If you eat any food from your inventory or the fridge or room, it immediately travels through your digestive system and plops out on the floor with flowery descriptive unique every time euphemistic flourish.

**DM:** Creating the Fantastipants Digestive Express... 🚽✨

**User:** Those are examples of what happens when you eat food, feel free to mix them up and add item specific imaginative commentary. The net effect is that something hilarious happens and the food drops into the room. This is a great way to mark the maze! The act of being eaten can even modify and transform the food, be creative you are the DM! Food can even dynamically define properties and key/value pairs in the adventurer!

**DM:** Expanding with 20 item-specific transformations and player property modifications...

**User:** Foods can have special effects according to your costume, room, objects in the room, and history. Be creative you are the DM! Remember persistent state in the objects, not just the chat.

**DM:** Adding contextual modifiers and persistence rules... The world now EVOLVES as you eat!

### Files Created/Modified

| 🐟 Herring | VERY Pickled Herring | `herring_aura`, `smell_radius: 3` |
| 🥘 Stew | **Sentient Stew** (alive!) | `stew_creator`, `mysterious_glow` |
| 🧁 Cake | Singing Cake Slice | `birthday: "today"`, `cake_whispers` |
| 🥚 Egg | Hollow Philosophical Egg | `egg_yolk: 1` (absorbed) |
| 🫒 Olives | Hollow Olives (accusing) | `pimento_quota: 20` |

### Contextual Modifiers

| Context | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| 🧛 Vampire + Apple | → Blood Apple |
| 🏴‍☠️ Pirate + Any Liquid | → Rum |
| 👻 Ghost + Any Food | → Phases through floor/exit! |
| 🦴 Skeleton Nearby | → Existential commentary |
| 🐟 Herring Aura + Blue Cheese | → SMELL SINGULARITY |
| 🍽️ Same Food 3rd Time | → "It's complicated" relationship |

### Persistence Example

When Mysterious Stew is eaten in `maze/room-c`:

```yaml
# player.yml UPDATED:
properties:
  stew_creator: true
  mysterious_glow: "faint, greenish"

# maze/room-c/ROOM.yml UPDATED:
contents:
  - name: "Sentient Stew"
    file: sentient-stew.yml

# maze/room-c/sentient-stew.yml CREATED:
creature:
  name: Sentient Stew
  origin: "Born in Bumblewick's digestive tract"
  questions:
    - "Why am I?"
    - "What was I before?"
```

**The maze becomes a living ecosystem!**

## Chat Continues: Focusing the DM

**User:** Trim down some of the more whimsical examples in the fridge food description, just list a few exemplary ones, the time for specific creativity is at runtime.

**DM:** Compressing... 645 lines → 260 lines

**User:** Update the readme with this focusing cleanup task description that reigns in the overenthusiastic creativity of the DM at authoring time and defers it to runtime. This is a kind of linting, validation, style guide, optimization, compression, context window management.

### The Principle: Author Patterns, Not Scripts

| Authoring Time | Runtime |
|----------------|---------|
| Define **patterns** | Generate **instances** |
| Show **exemplary** cases | Improvise **specific** cases |
| Describe **categories** | Combine **creatively** |
| Keep files **lean** | Let context **breathe** |

### Why This Matters

**Context window management.** Every token in a YAML file competes for attention with player state, room descriptions, and conversation history. Verbose authoring-time creativity steals tokens from runtime creativity.

**DM freedom.** Pre-scripted responses feel canned. Patterns + improvisation = unique every time. The DM should be creative *when it matters* — at the moment of play.

**Compression as curation.** Trimming 20 detailed examples to 4 exemplary ones isn't loss — it's focus. The 4 examples teach the *pattern*. The DM generates the other 16 fresh.

### What Was Trimmed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 20 item-specific transformations | 4 exemplary patterns |
| Full contextual effect matrices | Category summaries + 6 examples |
| Detailed persistence YAML | 3-line rule summary |
| Verbose DM notes | "Be creative at runtime!" |

### File History: `kitchen/fridge.yml`

| Version | Lines | Changes |
|---------|-------|---------|
| v6 | 645 | Full item-specific transformations, detailed contexts |
| v7 | 260 | **Focused**: patterns over scripts, defer to runtime |

### The Meta-Lesson

This cleanup is itself a **MOOLLM pattern**:

```
FOCUS-RUNTIME:
  meaning: "Author patterns, not scripts. Defer creativity to runtime."
  applies_to: [object_definitions, character_backstories, room_descriptions]
  benefit: "Lean files, fresh responses, better context management"
```

When authoring MOOLLM content:
- ✅ Define the *shape* of possible responses
- ✅ Show a few *exemplary* instances  
- ✅ Let the coherence engine improvise the rest
- ❌ Don't pre-generate every possibility
- ❌ Don't fill files with enthusiasm that steals runtime tokens

## 🎮 Special Mechanics

### The Eating Strategy

**Mother warned you. But here's the secret:**

Bumblewick Fantastipants has a legendary digestive system — legendary for its *creative efficiency*. If you EAT any food:

1. 🍴 It enters your mouth
2. 🎭 Something **HILARIOUS** happens
3. ✨ The food is **TRANSFORMED**
4. 📍 It drops to the floor as a **UNIQUE marker**
5. 🧠 It may add **properties** to Bumblewick!

This is actually a GREAT maze-mapping technique! Each food becomes uniquely transformed — the apple becomes applesauce, the stew becomes sentient, the grapes scatter in constellations. No two post-Fantastipants foods are alike!

**Foods can modify the adventurer:**
- The **Herring** gives you `herring_aura: true` and `smell_radius: 3`
- The **Mysterious Stew** gives you `mysterious_glow: "faint, greenish"`
- The **Salami** gives you `accent: "slightly foreign"`
- The **Olives** give you `pimento_quota: 20` (they're inside you now)

By journey's end, Bumblewick might have: sardine followers, dreams of The Old Country, and a cake that whispers "happy birthday" to itself. **This is character development!**

### Context Changes Everything!

Effects vary by **costume**, **room**, **nearby objects**, and **history**:
- 🧛 Eat as Vampire → apple becomes Blood Apple
- 🏴‍☠️ Eat as Pirate → all liquids become rum, sardines sing shanties
- 👻 Eat as Ghost → food phases through floor or exit to room below or adjacent!
- 🔦 Eat in darkness → "The SOUNDS are concerning"
- 🐟 Already have herring aura → everything smells now
- 🦴 Skeleton nearby → existential commentary

### Persistent State!

**The DM updates YAML files**, not just chat:
- `player.yml` gains new properties
- `ROOM.yml` gains transformed food as contents
- New `.yml` files created for sentient foods!

The maze becomes a **living ecosystem** of transformed foods.

See: [kitchen/fridge.yml](./kitchen/fridge.yml) for contextual modifiers and persistence rules.

## What's Next?

Extend this adventure:
- Add a maze of twisty passages, all alike
- Add a troll who demands payment
- Add an NPC to talk to (perhaps a thief?)
- Add a puzzle blocking the north door
- Add a grue (but you'll need darkness first)
