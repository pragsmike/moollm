# MOOLLM Protocol Symbols
# Wikipedia-style keywords for protocols and principles
#
# These are K-LINES (Minsky): symbolic activators that invoke conceptual clusters.
# Like Wikipedia's WP:FOO shorthand, but for agent behavior patterns.
# Typing "POSTEL" activates the entire tradition of charitable interpretation.
# These are like keys on a conceptual idea synthesizer keyboard 
# for playing chords of meaning and behavior.
#
# Usage:
#   - Type symbol as command: "YAML-JAZZ" invokes jazz interpretation
#   - Reference in docs: "per APPEND-ONLY, never modify"
#   - Chat signifier: "POSTEL this hostile message"
#   - K-line activation: name → tradition → behavior
#
# All symbols are UPPER-CASE, multi-word separated by dashes

# CORE PRINCIPLES
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COHERENCE-ENGINE:
  meaning: "The LLM computes dependencies, cross-checks data, referees parallel tasks, orchestrates character simulations, transcribes conversations, and maintains consistency across distributed state."
  location: kernel/README.md
  invoke_when: "Understanding the LLM's role in the system"
  # The orchestrator is the OS
  # The LLM is the Coherence Engine
  # The repo is the Microworld
  responsibilities:
    - "Compute logical dependencies between tasks"
    - "Cross-check data against rules and schemas"
    - "Referee conflicts between parallel agents"
    - "Orchestrate many character simulations in one call"
    - "Maintain consistency across distributed state"
    - "Resolve ambiguity via POSTEL (charitable interpretation)"

YAML-JAZZ:
  meaning: "Comments carry meaning. Data is interpreted, not just parsed."
  location: kernel/constitution-core.md §3
  invoke_when: "Writing or reading YAML with semantic intent"
  # Start with jazz, end with standards

FILES-AS-STATE:
  meaning: "Everything is files. No hidden memory."
  location: kernel/constitution-core.md §2
  invoke_when: "Questioning where state lives"

WHY-REQUIRED:
  meaning: "Every tool call must include why parameter."
  location: kernel/tool-calling-protocol.md §4
  invoke_when: "Making or reviewing tool calls"

APPEND-ONLY:
  meaning: "Never modify, only append. Audit trail is sacred."
  location: kernel/constitution-template.md §2
  invoke_when: "Writing to output.md or session-log.md"

COMMENTS-MATTER:
  meaning: "YAML comments are semantic, not decoration."
  location: kernel/constitution-core.md §3
  shorthand: "CM"
  invoke_when: "Adding context to YAML that structured fields cannot capture"

MINIMAL-DIFF:
  meaning: "Change only what's necessary."
  location: kernel/constitution-core.md §1
  invoke_when: "Editing existing files"

BIG-ENDIAN-NAMING:
  meaning: "Most significant component first in names. Files cluster by entity."
  location: kernel/NAMING.yml
  invoke_when: "Naming files, especially chats and metadata"
  examples:
    - "alan-kay.yml"              # Entity first
    - "alan-kay-chat-smalltalk.yml"  # Entity + type + topic
    - "readme-prototype-dialogue.yml"  # Two entities
  principle: |
    # The filesystem IS the semantic network.
    # Names that sort together belong together.
    # Prefix implies ownership/aboutness.
  related: [ABOUT-NOT-INSIDE, PREFIX-OWNERSHIP]

ABOUT-NOT-INSIDE:
  meaning: "Conversations ABOUT objects don't live INSIDE them."
  term: "Sidecar files for metadata and sub-objects"
  location: kernel/NAMING.yml
  invoke_when: "Deciding where to place chats, reviews, notes"
  examples:
    good:
      - "readme-chat.yml"              # In project root
      - "kernel-constitution-review.yml"  # Near but not in
    bad:
      - "skills/soul-chat/sessions/CHAT.yml"  # Trapped
      - "kernel/constitution/discussion.yml"  # Buried
  why: |
    # Chats have their own lifecycle
    # Multiple chats about same subject cluster
    # Chats are first-class objects, not metadata

PREFIX-OWNERSHIP:
  meaning: "File prefix implies belonging. Portable possession."
  location: kernel/NAMING.yml
  invoke_when: "Files need to indicate owner without being inside owner's directory"
  example: |
    # don-hopkins-wish-list.md belongs to don-hopkins
    # Can live anywhere and still indicate ownership
    # Can move into don-hopkins/ and drop prefix

README-EVERYWHERE:
  meaning: "Every directory deserves its own README.md"
  location: kernel/NAMING.yml
  invoke_when: "Creating or organizing directories"
  why:
    - "GitHub auto-formats README.md"
    - "Human-readable entry point"
    - "Hypertext index with relative links"
    - "Supports mermaid diagrams, badges, etc."
  rule: "READMEs link to each other. Intertwingled."

NO-VERSIONS:
  meaning: "There is only one self-consistent universe. No runtime version resolution."
  invoke_when: "Tempted to add version: fields"
  philosophy: |
    # Forget the past! 
    # Do not dare to resolve versions at runtime!
    # The current state IS the state.
    # Git provides history if you need archaeology.

  meaning: "Rules and structures persuade. The simulation IS the argument."
  origin: "Ian Bogost — 'an unholy blend of Will Wright and Aristotle'"
  location: skills/procedural-rhetoric/
  invoke_when: "Designing schemas, rules, or constraints that embody values"
  
  key_insight: |
    # Games persuade through PROCESSES, not just words.
    # When The Sims allows same-sex relationships without comment,
    # the RULES embody a worldview. The structure IS the ideology.
    # YAML schemas, action advertisements, and protocol constraints
    # are all procedural rhetoric: the structure carries meaning.
    
  in_moollm:
    schemas: "What you can express → what is thinkable"
    advertisements: "What actions are offered → what is possible"
    constraints: "What is forbidden → what is normative"
    defaults: "What happens automatically → what is assumed"
    
  examples:
    - "Symmetric relationship rules = equality as default"
    - "POSTEL = assume good intent as design principle"
    - "FILES-AS-STATE = transparency as architecture"
    - "YAML-JAZZ comments = meaning embedded in configuration"
    
  warning: |
    # For better or worse, rules carry ideology.
    # Design consciously. Your schemas have opinions.
    # Procedural rhetoric can enlighten or entrench.
    # Choose deliberately.

MASKING-EFFECT:
  meaning: "Abstract characters + detailed backgrounds = projective identification."
  origin: "Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics"
  invoke_when: "Designing characters, templates, or avatars"
  
  insight: |
    # Simplified characters let players PROJECT themselves.
    # A smiley face can represent anyone.
    # A photograph represents only that person.
    # The Sims uses simple character models in detailed worlds
    # so players identify WITH the characters, not just observe them.
    
  in_moollm: |
    # Characters are abstract YAML templates
    # Rooms and objects can be richly detailed
    # The abstraction IS the feature
    # Players fill in the gaps with imagination
    
SIMULATOR-EFFECT:
  meaning: "Players imagine more complexity than exists. Don't talk them out of it."
  origin: "Will Wright"
  invoke_when: "Designing simulations, deciding how much to reveal"
  
  insight: |
    # "Players imagine your simulation is vastly more detailed,
    #  rich, and complex than it actually is — don't talk them out of it."
    # Games run on TWO computers:
    # 1. The electronic one on the desk (your sparse simulation)
    # 2. The biological one in the player's head (their rich imagination)
    # The player's mind does the heavy lifting.
    
  in_moollm: |
    # Sparse YAML descriptions invoke rich mental images
    # The LLM fills gaps
    # The player's mind completes the world
    # Resist over-specifying — leave room for imagination

GUTTER-CLOSURE:
  meaning: "The action happens BETWEEN panels. Readers fill in the gaps."
  origin: "Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics"
  invoke_when: "Deciding what to show vs. imply"
  
  insight: |
    # McCloud's gutters: the space between comic panels where readers
    # imagine the action. Show the axe raised, show the scream — the
    # reader imagines the murder. The imagination does the violence.
    #
    # In MOOLLM: the space between YAML files, between rooms, between
    # actions. We don't simulate every step — the coherence engine
    # and player's imagination fill the gaps.
    
  in_moollm:
    - "Space between rooms = travel narrative"
    - "Space between actions = time passing"
    - "Space between files = implied connections"
    - "The LLM IS the gutter — it closes the gaps"

  origin: "Will Wright — The Zodiac Decision"
  invoke_when: "Deciding whether to invent new terms or use familiar ones"
  
  story: |
    # The Sims team debated: invent "SimSigns" or use real zodiac signs?
    # Will Wright argued FOR using real signs — he WANTED the baggage.
    # Players would project their beliefs about Leos onto Leo Sims.
    #
    # THE KICKER: Testers complained zodiac signs had "too much effect"
    # on Sim behavior... BEFORE ANY CODE WAS HOOKED UP.
    # Pure confirmation bias. The simulator effect in action.
    
  in_moollm:
    - "Use 'lamp' not 'portable illumination device'"

  story: |
    # The Sims supported same-sex relationships from launch (2000).

  insight: |
    # The Sims' AI isn't centralized — it's scripted in "SimAntics"

    # A refrigerator knows it offers food.
    # A bed knows it offers sleep.
    # The Sim chooses from what's advertised nearby.
    #
    # This IS MOOLLM's advertisement system! Objects announce what
    # they can do. The coherence engine orchestrates, but intelligence
    # is distributed throughout the world.
    
  in_moollm:

  # This IS The Sims interaction model:
  # - Objects ADVERTISE their available actions
  # - Actions are SCORED based on context and needs
  # - High-scoring actions appear prominently in pie menu
  # - Cursor snaps to object, pie radiates outward
  
  behavior: |
    # When turtle/cursor approaches an object:
    1. Snap to object position (magnetic attraction)
    2. Object advertises available actions with scores
    3. Show pie menu with actions sorted by score
    4. Highlight clickable links in rendered markdown
    
  advertisement_scoring: |
    # Each action has a score based on:
    - Relevance to current goal
    - Character needs/state
    - Object state (is it usable?)

    # Example: workbench advertises
    workbench:
      advertises:
        - action: EXAMINE
          score: 80  # Always relevant
        - action: USE
          score: 95  # High if you have materials
        - action: GET
          score: 20  # Heavy, not portable
