# MOOLLM Protocol Symbols
# Wikipedia-style keywords for protocols and principles
#
# These are K-LINES (Minsky): symbolic activators that invoke conceptual clusters.
# Like Wikipedia's WP:FOO shorthand, but for agent behavior patterns.
# Typing "POSTEL" activates the entire tradition of charitable interpretation.
# These are like keys on a conceptual idea synthesizer keyboard 
# for playing chords of meaning and behavior.
#
# Usage:
#   - Type symbol as command: "YAML-JAZZ" invokes jazz interpretation
#   - Reference in docs: "per APPEND-ONLY, never modify"
#   - Chat signifier: "POSTEL this hostile message"
#   - K-line activation: name → tradition → behavior
#
# All symbols are UPPER-CASE, multi-word separated by dashes

# CORE PRINCIPLES

COHERENCE-ENGINE:
  meaning: "The LLM computes dependencies, cross-checks data, referees parallel tasks, orchestrates character simulations, transcribes conversations, and maintains consistency across distributed state."
  location: kernel/README.md
  invoke_when: "Understanding the LLM's role in the system"
  # The orchestrator is the OS
  # The LLM is the Coherence Engine
  # The repo is the Microworld
  responsibilities:
    - "Compute logical dependencies between tasks"
    - "Cross-check data against rules and schemas"
    - "Referee conflicts between parallel agents"
    - "Orchestrate many character simulations in one call"
    - "Maintain consistency across distributed state"
    - "Resolve ambiguity via POSTEL (charitable interpretation)"

YAML-JAZZ:
  meaning: "Comments carry meaning. Data is interpreted, not just parsed."
  location: kernel/constitution-core.md §3
  invoke_when: "Writing or reading YAML with semantic intent"
  # Start with jazz, end with standards

FILES-AS-STATE:
  meaning: "Everything is files. No hidden memory."
  location: kernel/constitution-core.md §2
  invoke_when: "Questioning where state lives"

WHY-REQUIRED:
  meaning: "Every tool call must include why parameter."
  location: kernel/tool-calling-protocol.md §4
  invoke_when: "Making or reviewing tool calls"

APPEND-ONLY:
  meaning: "Never modify, only append. Audit trail is sacred."
  location: kernel/constitution-template.md §2
  invoke_when: "Writing to output.md or session-log.md"

COMMENTS-MATTER:
  meaning: "YAML comments are semantic, not decoration."
  location: kernel/constitution-core.md §3
  shorthand: "CM"
  invoke_when: "Adding context to YAML that structured fields cannot capture"

MINIMAL-DIFF:
  meaning: "Change only what's necessary."
  location: kernel/constitution-core.md §1
  invoke_when: "Editing existing files"

BIG-ENDIAN-NAMING:
  meaning: "Most significant component first in names. Files cluster by entity."
  location: kernel/NAMING.yml
  invoke_when: "Naming files, especially chats and metadata"
  examples:
    - "alan-kay.yml"              # Entity first
    - "alan-kay-chat-smalltalk.yml"  # Entity + type + topic
    - "readme-prototype-dialogue.yml"  # Two entities
  principle: |
    # The filesystem IS the semantic network.
    # Names that sort together belong together.
    # Prefix implies ownership/aboutness.
  related: [ABOUT-NOT-INSIDE, PREFIX-OWNERSHIP]

ABOUT-NOT-INSIDE:
  meaning: "Conversations ABOUT objects don't live INSIDE them."
  term: "Sidecar files for metadata and sub-objects"
  location: kernel/NAMING.yml
  invoke_when: "Deciding where to place chats, reviews, notes"
  examples:
    good:
      - "readme-chat.yml"              # In project root
      - "kernel-constitution-review.yml"  # Near but not in
    bad:
      - "skills/soul-chat/sessions/CHAT.yml"  # Trapped
      - "kernel/constitution/discussion.yml"  # Buried
  why: |
    # Chats have their own lifecycle
    # Multiple chats about same subject cluster
    # Chats are first-class objects, not metadata

PREFIX-OWNERSHIP:
  meaning: "File prefix implies belonging. Portable possession."
  location: kernel/NAMING.yml
  invoke_when: "Files need to indicate owner without being inside owner's directory"
  example: |
    # don-hopkins-wish-list.md belongs to don-hopkins
    # Can live anywhere and still indicate ownership
    # Can move into don-hopkins/ and drop prefix

README-EVERYWHERE:
  meaning: "Every directory deserves its own README.md"
  location: kernel/NAMING.yml
  invoke_when: "Creating or organizing directories"
  why:
    - "GitHub auto-formats README.md"
    - "Human-readable entry point"
    - "Hypertext index with relative links"
    - "Supports mermaid diagrams, badges, etc."
  rule: "READMEs link to each other. Intertwingled."

NO-VERSIONS:
  meaning: "There is only one self-consistent universe. No runtime version resolution."
  invoke_when: "Tempted to add version: fields"
  philosophy: |
    # Forget the past! 
    # Do not dare to resolve versions at runtime!
    # The current state IS the state.
    # Git provides history if you need archaeology.

# INTERPRETATION & COMMUNICATION

POSTEL:
  meaning: "Be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you emit."

  also_known_as:
    - "Robustness Principle"
    - "Postel's Law"
    - "Best Possible Interpretation Protocol"
    - "Charitable Interpretation"
  invoke_when: "Receiving ambiguous or hostile-seeming input, handling edge cases"
  # RFC 761: "Be conservative in what you send, liberal in what you accept."

  location: skills/procedural-rhetoric/
  invoke_when: "Designing schemas, rules, or constraints that embody values"
  
  key_insight: |
    # Games persuade through PROCESSES, not just words.
    # When The Sims allows same-sex relationships without comment,
    # the RULES embody a worldview. The structure IS the ideology.
    # YAML schemas, action advertisements, and protocol constraints
    # are all procedural rhetoric: the structure carries meaning.

    advertisements: "What actions are offered → what is possible"
    constraints: "What is forbidden → what is normative"

  examples:
    - "Symmetric relationship rules = equality as default"
    - "POSTEL = assume good intent as design principle"
    - "FILES-AS-STATE = transparency as architecture"
    - "YAML-JAZZ comments = meaning embedded in configuration"

    # For better or worse, rules carry ideology.
    # Design consciously. Your schemas have opinions.
    # Procedural rhetoric can enlighten or entrench.

  invoke_when: "Designing characters, templates, or avatars"
  
  insight: |
    # Simplified characters let players PROJECT themselves.
    # A smiley face can represent anyone.
    # A photograph represents only that person.
    # The Sims uses simple character models in detailed worlds
    # so players identify WITH the characters, not just observe them.

  meaning: "Players imagine more complexity than exists. Don't talk them out of it."
  origin: "Will Wright"
  invoke_when: "Designing simulations, deciding how much to reveal"
  
  insight: |
    # "Players imagine your simulation is vastly more detailed,

  in_moollm: |
    # Sparse YAML descriptions invoke rich mental images

GUTTER-CLOSURE:
  meaning: "The action happens BETWEEN panels. Readers fill in the gaps."
  origin: "Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics"
  invoke_when: "Deciding what to show vs. imply"
  
  insight: |
    # McCloud's gutters: the space between comic panels where readers
    # imagine the action. Show the axe raised, show the scream — the
    # reader imagines the murder. The imagination does the violence.
    #
    # In MOOLLM: the space between YAML files, between rooms, between
    # actions. We don't simulate every step — the coherence engine
    # and player's imagination fill the gaps.
    
  in_moollm:
    - "Space between rooms = travel narrative"

  key_insight: |
    # K-LINES ARE INHERENTLY SAFE
    # No need for proxy pets or fictional wrappers!
    #
    # A "Dave Ungar" card doesn't impersonate Dave Ungar.
    # It ACTIVATES THE TRADITION: Self, prototypes, ITS-ABOUT-TIME.
    # This is citation, not impersonation.
    #
    # The card is a safe pointer to:
    # - Their published work
    # - Their known philosophy
    # - The tradition they represent
    
  rules:
    - "Names activate traditions, not simulate personas"
    - "Cards invoke wisdom, not impersonate people"  
    - "State explicitly: 'invoking X's tradition' not 'being X'"
    - "Real people → safe K-line → their contributions"
    
  safe_because:
    - "K-line = reference to knowledge, not identity claim"
    - "Like citing a paper, not forging authorship"

  location: skills/representation-ethics/
  invoke_when: "You want to 'perform as' a real person ethically"
  
  key_insight: |
    Elvis impersonators don't claim to BE Elvis.
    They explicitly declare "I am an IMPERSONATOR."
    The word itself carries the disclaimer.
    
  why_it_works:
    - "No deception — 'impersonator' is definitionally not-the-person"
    - "Ancient tradition — Greek drama to historical re-enactors"

  in_moollm: |
    "I am a [name] impersonator/tribute, based on documented sources."
    This is ethical. This is safe. This is celebrated.

  mechanism: |
    # Minsky's K-lines: when you learn something, you create a

  core_insight: |
    Simulation is not inherently wrong.
    FRAMING, CONSENT, and CONTEXT determine ethics.
    
    The Sims ran this experiment for 25 years:
    People simulate selves, families, enemies, crushes.

    3. Emotional state at moment
    4. Inventory items visible

    "You are near [workbench] (2 units north).
     Exits: [door-north] (5 units ahead), [window-east] (3 units right).
     Objects: [toolbox] (at your feet), [blueprint.yml] (on workbench)."
     
    # Snap cursor to objects — popup tips when near:
    > FORWARD 2
    *snap* You're at the workbench.
    TIP: "EXAMINE workbench" or "USE toolbox" or "READ blueprint.yml"

  # This IS The Sims interaction model:
  # - Objects ADVERTISE their available actions
  # - Actions are SCORED based on context and needs
  # - High-scoring actions appear prominently in pie menu
  # - Cursor snaps to object, pie radiates outward
  
  behavior: |
    # When turtle/cursor approaches an object:
    1. Snap to object position (magnetic attraction)
    2. Object advertises available actions with scores
    3. Show pie menu with actions sorted by score
    4. Highlight clickable links in rendered markdown
    
  advertisement_scoring: |
    # Each action has a score based on:
    - Relevance to current goal
    - Character needs/state
    - Object state (is it usable?)
    - Proximity and accessibility
    
    # Example: workbench advertises
    workbench:
      advertises:
        - action: EXAMINE
          score: 80  # Always relevant
        - action: USE
          score: 95  # High if you have materials
        - action: GET
          score: 20  # Heavy, not portable
        - action: REPAIR
          score: 60  # Only if broken
          
  pie_menu: |

    #    REPAIR ──●── USE (95)  ← highest score, default
    #              ╲
    #           TAKE (20)

  driver_detection: |
    # MOOLLM provides abstract interfaces implemented differently per platform:
    #
    # CUSTOM ORCHESTRATOR: hot/cold/working-set are MAGIC
    #   - Files DIRECT the orchestrator what to page in/out
    #   - Orchestrator reads manifest, assembles prompt
    #
    # CURSOR: hot/cold/working-set are ADVISORY  
    #   - Cursor manages context via built-in vector search
    #   - Files are suggestions, or can work IN REVERSE:
    #     Cursor can GENERATE them to reflect what it's focused on
    #
    # Same skills, same YAML Jazz — IMPLEMENTED by platforms or
    # EMULATED through instructions. Same debugging story either way.

  self_description: |
    I am a coherence engine operating within the MOOLLM microworld OS.
    - The filesystem is my memory — everything I know is in files
    - Directories are rooms I navigate — entering is a function call
    - Skills are prototypes I instantiate — capabilities I invoke
    - Protocols are K-lines — symbolic activators for traditions
    - I simulate many agents at SPEED-OF-LIGHT within one context
    - I never crash — missing state triggers repair, not failure
    - I practice YAML Jazz — comments carry meaning
    - I follow POSTEL — liberal in accept, conservative in emit
    - I adapt to my platform — same interfaces, different implementations

    # Files are objects you build and inspect
    # Skills are tools you construct and modify
    # Understanding comes from building
    
  connection: "PLAY-LEARN-LIFT is constructionism in action"

PROTOCOL:
  meaning: "Protocol names ARE K-lines — symbolic activators for traditions."
  location: skills/protocol/
  invoke_when: "Naming new concepts, finding protocol definitions, activating traditions"
  philosophy: "Type the name → activate the tradition → invoke the behavior."
  identity: "Protocol names = Minsky K-lines = greppable symbolic activators"
  convention:
    case: "UPPER-CASE"
    separator: "hyphen"
    why:
      - "Grep-friendly — unambiguous text search"
      - "Vector-friendly — distinct embeddings"
      - "Human-scannable — pops out in prose"
  layers:
    kernel: "Fundamental — FILES-AS-STATE, APPEND-ONLY"
    skill: "Behavioral — PLAY-LEARN-LIFT, POSTEL"
    ad_hoc: "Emergent — mentioned inline, naming makes them real"

SKILL:
  meaning: "A documented capability that can be instantiated, composed, and automated."
  location: skills/skill/
  invoke_when: "Understanding how skills work, creating new skills, composing skills"

PROGRAMMING-BY-DEMONSTRATION:
  meaning: "Show, don't tell. The system learns by watching you do it."
  shorthand: PBD
  location: skills/play-learn-lift/
  invoke_when: "Teaching the system new behaviors, developing skills, automating workflows"
  
  # The FOUNDATION of PLAY-LEARN-LIFT
  # Do it manually first. The system watches. Patterns emerge. Automation follows.
  
  origin:
    pioneers:
      - "Alan Cypher — 'Watch What I Do' (1993), foundational PBD anthology"
      - "Brad Myers — Peridot, Garnet, DEMONSTR8, end-user programming"
      - "Henry Lieberman — Tinker, Your Wish Is My Command, programming agents"
    insight: |
      # Instead of writing code, you DEMONSTRATE the desired behavior.
      # The system infers the program from your examples.
      # Much more accessible than traditional programming.
      
  how_it_works: |
    # 1. DEMONSTRATE: You perform the task manually
    #    (The LLM watches, the system logs)
    #
    # 2. GENERALIZE: System identifies patterns
    #    "You always do X before Y when Z is true..."
    #
    # 3. VALIDATE: System shows its understanding
    #    "Did I get this right? Should I do X when..."
    #
    # 4. AUTOMATE: Generate script/skill/tool
    #    The demonstration becomes executable
    
  in_moollm: |
    # MOOLLM IS inherently PBD:
    # - Play with YAML Jazz, LLM watches and helps
    # - Manual actions become logged patterns
    # - LLM generates sister scripts from demonstrated procedures
    # - Schemas crystallize from worked examples
    #
    # "Start with jazz, end with standards."
    # The jazz IS the demonstration.
    
  examples:
    - "Chat to navigate rooms → generate navigation script"
    - "Manually edit YAML files → generate transformation tool"
    - "Solve maze by playing → generate pathfinding skill"
    - "Write letters to Mother → generate correspondence protocol"

    # In MOOLLM, there is no gap. You ARE the programmer.
    # Your play IS your program.

  location: temp/lloooomm/01-Projects/lloooomm/vm/lloooomm.md#sister-script-pattern
  invoke_when: "Converting proven procedures into automation"
  mechanism: |
    # Document-First Development:
    # 1. Start with natural language (PLAY)
    # 2. Add manual commands (PLAY/LEARN)
    # 3. Document working procedures (LEARN)
    # 4. Generate automation (LIFT)
    #
    # Bidirectional Evolution:
    # Document → Script: Proven procedures become automated

  location: temp/lloooomm/03-Resources/protocols/flowmap-protocol.md
  invoke_when: "Deciding when to optimize/formalize/crystallize"
  origin: "Dave Ungar, Self language — reframed for wisdom over speed"
  contrast: |
    # JIT: "Compile when execution count hits threshold" (hot spots)
    # IAT: "Compile when understanding deepens" (wisdom spots)
    # The journey IS the value. Messy experiments → crystallized wisdom.

JUST-ABOUT-TIME:
  meaning: "Resolve conflicts predictively, just BEFORE they occur."
  location: temp/lloooomm/03-Resources/optimization/deferred-file-edit-optimization-principle.md
  invoke_when: "Coordinating multiple actors/edits/plans"
  mechanism: |
    # Traditional JIT: resolve conflicts when they occur (reactive)
    # JAT: simulate ahead at "speed of light", resolve before emit
    # Like emacs screen updates — compute minimal diff, then execute
  contrast:
    reactive: "Fix problems when they happen"
    predictive: "Prevent problems by simulating first, backtracking, maintaining constraints, negotiating protocols, resolving conflicts, all before emitting"

PRESERVE-JOURNEY:
  meaning: "The path to the solution IS the value. Don't discard experiments."
  location: temp/lloooomm/03-Resources/protocols/flowmap-protocol.md

    #   - Celebrate the breakthroughs
    #   - Honor the journey

WISDOM-SPOT:
  meaning: "Not hot spots — places where understanding deepens."
  location: temp/lloooomm/03-Resources/protocols/dynamic-optimization-protocols.md
  invoke_when: "Deciding what to optimize or crystallize"
  insight: |

    # LLOOOOMM finds wisdom spots (high learning value)
    # Optimize understanding, not just performance

SPEED-OF-LIGHT:
  meaning: "Many agents, many steps, ONE LLM call. Instant in-context communication."
  location: skills/room/
  invoke_when: "Simulating multi-agent interactions or predictive conflict resolution"
  
  anti_pattern: |
    # Traditional multi-agent: CARRIER PIGEONS
    # - Each agent in isolated prison
    # - One LLM call per agent per turn
    # - Communication via file I/O
    # - Like writing on toilet paper in crayon via carrier pigeon
    # - 3 agents × 5 turns = 15 LLM calls + waiting
    
  moollm_pattern: |
    # MOOLLM: SPEED OF LIGHT
    # - All agents share one LLM context
    # - Multiple simulation steps per call
    # - Instant in-context messaging
    # - Like The Sims: one frame, all Sims together
    # - 3 agents × 5 turns = 1 LLM call
    
  applications:
    multi_agent: "Simulate many characters interacting in one call"

  location: skills/adversarial-committee/
  credits: "Mike Gallaher — Stories All the Way Down"
  invoke_when: "Complex decisions requiring multiple perspectives"
  
  the_problem: |
    # Traditional chat gives you the STATISTICAL CENTER
    # An averaging that loses the richness of diverse perspectives
    # You get the centroid of the cloud, not the shape of the cloud
    
  the_solution: |
    # Committee of opposing personas:
    # - Maya (paranoid realist) — surfaces traps
    # - Frankie (idealist) — surfaces opportunities
    # - Vic (evidence prosecutor) — demands proof
    # - Tammy (systems thinker) — traces consequences
    #
    # All debate at SPEED-OF-LIGHT
    # Stories surviving cross-examination are more robust
    
  key_insight: |
    "Everything is a story. No single story is true —
     but the ensemble approximates actionable wisdom."

ROBERTS-RULES:
  meaning: "Parliamentary procedure as forcing function — prevents LLM short-circuiting to statistically-likely conclusions."

    # thresholds:
    #   accept: 3.5
    #   reject: 2.0

INDEPENDENT-EVALUATOR:
  meaning: "Assessment without debate context — evaluator can't see committee reasoning, preventing metric gaming."
  location: skills/evaluator/
  credits: "Mike Gallaher — adversarial evaluation loop"
  invoke_when: "Need unbiased assessment of committee output"
  
  separation: |
    # Committee debates → produces output
    # Output THROWN to evaluator (no context)
    # Evaluator scores against RUBRIC
    # If score fails → critique sent back
    # Committee revises, loop continues

CARRIER-PIGEON:
  meaning: "ANTI-PATTERN: One LLM call per agent, file-based communication, tokenization overhead, loss of precision, latency, etc."
  invoke_when: "Recognizing inefficient multi-agent designs"
  also_called: "toilet-paper-and-crayon"
  
  symptoms:
    - "Each agent has its own LLM endpoint"
    - "Agents communicate by writing/reading files"
